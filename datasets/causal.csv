Within the Co-ReSyF platform it can be identified two major components that support the operation of the research activities performed within the platform.,0,0,,,,,,,,
"One component is the Framework, which is composed of all the things that support the environment where the applications are defined and executed, and the other component are the Tools which are things that can be used to build an application and to analyse/visualize the results of the application.",0,0,,,,,,,,
"The Framework includes the Cloud back-end, which is the infrastructure that runs the applications in the cloud and is in charge of coordinating and creating the VMs for distributed processing and collection of input and output data.",0,0,,,,,,,,
"The other part of the framework is related to the user interaction and it is the part that directly interfaces with the user, this includes the Front- end (GUI that provides the connection to all the platform functionalities) and the Expert Centre and Knowledge Base (wiki with relevant information for newcomers of the platform to start using it).",0,0,,,,,,,,
The Tools live within the Framework and are a set of executables or libraries that can be used by the researchers to build and manage their applications or handle the data.,0,0,,,,,,,,
It includes the Automated Orchestration which is a set of tools designed to configure and monitor the execution of the sequence of tasks that compose one application.,0,0,,,,,,,,
"The Image Inter-calibration, Atmospheric corrections, Data Co-registration and Fusion and Other tools, which are tools used to process the data commonly used by several applications and provided in a default tool-kit available to all users of the platform.",0,0,,,,,,,,
"Finally there is also a set of Visualisation tools, which are provided as default by the platform that allow the users to visualise and manipulate the data is commonly used data visualization tools (different from the main front-end data visualization provided with the platform).",0,0,,,,,,,,
This document focuses solely on the Tools part of the Co-ReSyF platform.,0,0,,,,,,,,
The Co-ReSyF platform is envisaged to help researchers analysing EO data.,0,0,,,,,,,,
"One of the biggest advantages of using Co-ReSyF is when the data to be analyzed has a significant size, where the researcher will be able to access the cloud assets in order to process the data.",1,0,,,,,,,,
This means that the data is not being processed locally and it can also take some time before the processing is complete.,0,1,,,,,,,,
It then becomes important to have mechanisms that can provide feedback to the user of the current status of the processing and that also ensure that the processing is correctly executed.,0,0,,,,,,,,
ARGANS background in remote sensing image inter-comparison and inter-calibration derives from involvement in radiometric calibration of medium resolution optical multi-spectral sensors (DIMITRI (https://dimitri.argans.co.uk)) and involvement with MERIS match-up in-situ database (MERMAID (http://mermaid.acri.fr/home/home.php)).,0,0,,,,,,,,
Inter-calibration provide a practical means of identifying and correcting relative biases in radiometric calibration between instruments.,0,0,,,,,,,,
One approach to inter-calibration is to use a well-characterized instrument as a reference to compare with other instruments viewing the same target under near-simultaneous conditions.,0,0,,,,,,,,
"But there are problems for coastal Type II waters since PICS tend to be land sites, e.g. desert, salt lakes, snow; and both Rayleigh and glint procedures requires low chlorophyl and low aerosol.",0,0,,,,,,,,
The coastal zone is dynamic and the marine signal measures by satellite sensors strongly affected by land contamination effects.,0,0,,,,,,,,
"Another approach is vicarious ground-based calibration in which surface measurements and radiative transfer models are used to estimate theoretical at-sensor radiance and correct biases in measured Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) radiances, provides absolute calibration enabling direct inter-calibration of sensor images with relatively high accuracy.",0,0,,,,,,,,
For this in-situ data is needed (http://mermaid.acri.fr/home/home.php)) it is expensive and labour intensive to acquire.,0,0,,,,,,,,
It also requires inversion of Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) which is sensitive to climatological and atmospheric parameters.,0,0,,,,,,,,
"A possible approximate solution would be to perform relative calibration between sensors based on a set of invariant sites: PICS, Rayleigh and sun glint; and generalise that the bias and coastal test site.",0,0,,,,,,,,
For Sentinel-2 Multi-spectral Imager (MSI) (https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi) these correction coefficients are not provided with the image metadata and would need to be generated within the framework.,0,0,,,,,,,,
This may result in significant uncertainty since the spectral signature at the coast is not invariant.,1,1,,,,,,,,
A better approach would be to directly compare sensors by matching up images of the AOI based on viewing angle and illumination and normalise the images based on the sensor spectral response function (SRF).,0,0,,,,,,,,
But this requires a long time series so that sufficient match-ups between images are available.,1,0,,,,,,,,
And it does not consider that cross-sensor wavelength variations in SRF that can lead to measurement discrepencies between sensors.,0,0,,,,,,,,
"A compensation for differences in SRF can be made by integrating the SRF of the sensor with the spectral signature of the target, the Spectral Band Adjustment Factor (SBAF) but as stated before the dynamic nature of the coastal spectral signature complicates the characterisation of the reference sensor simulated TOA reflectance.",0,0,,,,,,,,
In the wider context of the strategic fit to the framework it is important to be able to combine data from multiple satellite sensors and data from the same satellite sensor acquired over a period of time.,0,0,,,,,,,,
"It is possible to create a composite image simply by normalising the image set using an image manipulation package but if the aim is to derive geophysical measurements care is needed to ensure inter-calibration considers the differing spectral response of the sensors, the observing and environmental conditions, and the spectral signature of the target.",1,,,,,,,,,
In dynamic and heterogenous coastal zones absolute calibration and sensor inter-comparison is a challenging problem.,0,0,,,,,,,,
"Inter-calibration, e.g. normalizing multiple images to a common radiometric scale, is distinct from sensor calibration, a process performed during Ground Segment processing and monitoring to ensure baseline data quality requirements are met.",0,0,,,,,,,,
Implicitly that quantifying and correcting relative bias between monitored and reference sensors for collocated data can be generalised to measurements by the same pair of satellites even when they are not being directly compared.,1,0,,,,,,,,
Geometrical calibration will have been performed on data retrieved from repositories.,0,0,,,,,,,,
Atmospheric correction will be provided by the framework [see CORESYF-TOOL-ATCORR].,0,0,,,,,,,,
"A reference standard has been identified i.e. a stable well-calibrated satellite instrument that provide temporal, spatial, spectral and geometric collocation with the sensors to be inter-calibrated or an appropriate stable pseudo-invariant calibration site (PICS) or a well- characterised instrumented in situ site.",0,0,,,,,,,,
From a series of data from a reference sensor and target sensor(s) derive calibration coefficients to align the radiometry of the target sensors with the reference sensor.,0,0,,,,,,,,
"By re-scaling all sensors to the same radiometric scale a consistent set of acquisitions over a given site, covering a broad range of geometries, is generated.",1,0,,,,,,,,
Absolute calibration of images is probably out-of-scope considering the resources allocated to this tool (5 months) and the requirement for a reasonably long time series of Sentinel-2 data to ensure there are a significant number of matchup images sharing geometrical and temporal viewing and illumination characteristics.,1,0,,,,,,,,
If there is a necessity for inter-calibration of SAR images input is required from another partner with the relevant knowledge.,1,1,,,,,,,,
Detection using remote sensing is based on geometry and radiometry.,0,0,,,,,,,,
"Using radiometry often requires to apply a solid atmospheric correction algorithm, especially regarding water colour as the signal is quite low.",0,1,,,,,,,,
"Indeed, up to 90% of the signal sensed by the satellite can be related to the atmosphere so it is primordial to correct that in order to clear any noise affecting the water colour.",0,0,,,,,,,,
For the second version of the Co-ReSyF platform it is envisaged to explore the potential of synergies between the different applications.,0,0,,,,,,,,
"In order to be able to exploit these synergies, the applications that will combine the data from other applications, will need generic tools for co- registration and fusion of the data.",1,1,,,,,,,,
For the development of the Co-ReSyF applications several tools are identified as needed for the data processing that are useful to many other applications and are generic enough to be applied to a certain type of data in many use cases.,0,0,,,,,,,,
"When analysing the data, either output or input data, the users may need some tools for data visualization and manipulation that are generic enough to consider them as useful to all users of the platform.",1,1,,,,,,,,
These tools are then identified as being tools for visualization that should be included in the Co-ReSyF default tool-kit.,0,0,,,,,,,,

This capability will likely be implemented using a mission control on Earth.,,,,0,0,,,,,
"Logically, there will be times when the crew is unavailable to monitor, operate, and control the system.",,,,0,0,,,,,

"Rationale: FSW maintenance tasks include, but are not limited to, memory management, data storage management, application refresh, self-tests, etc.",,,,,0,0,,,,
"Given that communication with the Ground will be minimal and Crew visits infrequent, routine maintenance and servicing that keeps the software operating efficiently must be automated to eliminate dependencies on human operators.",,,,,1,1,,,,
These self-maintenance tasks will be conducted with minimal to no impact on Gateway operations during crewed and uncrewed flight phases.,,,,,1,1,,,,

"The intent is to provide isolation and recovery from faults where the system design (e.g., redundant strings or system isolation) enables the implementation of this capability.",,,,,0,1,,,,
"Also, any faults identified during system development should be protected by isolation and recovery.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"However, it is acknowledged that not all faults that would cause catastrophic events can be detected or isolated in time to avoid the event.",,,,,0,1,,,,
"Similarly, system design cannot ensure that once the fault is detected and isolated that a recovery is always possible.",,,,,0,1,,,,
"However, in these cases, isolation of the fault should prevent the catastrophic event.",,,,,1,1,,,,
The crewed Gateway shall provide the capability for the onboard crew to manually override software functionality when the transition to manual operation will not cause a catastrophic event.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"The intent of this requirement is to allow crew intervention of the crewed space system and/or subsystem software to perform operations that would nominally be automated, or when software design is incapable of responding appropriately or as desired to real-time events.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"While this capability should be derived by the program per requirement L2-GW-0310 Crew Monitor/Operate/Control Capability, the critical nature of software control and automation at the highest system level dictates specific mention in this requirement set.",,,,,0,1,,,,
"The displays and controls for manual intervention should be conveniently located, readily accessible, and intuitive for the intended task and its duration as long as the transition to/from manual operation is feasible and will not cause a catastrophic event.",,,,,0,1,,,,

The crewed Gateway shall provide the capability for the crew to manually control the attitude and translation of their crewed space system.,,,,,0,0,,,,
The capability for the crew to manually effect changes in the attitude and translation of Gateway is a fundamental element of crew survival.,,,,,0,0,,,,
"The most robust satisfaction of this requirement is provided by direct manual flight control of the vehicle translation and attitude, through an independent flight control pathway (bypassing the affected vehicle guidance, navigation, and control system failures).",,,,,0,1,,,,
A minimum implementation of manual flight control allows the crew to bypass the automated guidance of the vehicle by interfacing directly with the flight control system to effect any possible attitude or translation change/adjustment within the capability of Gateway’s design.,,,,,0,1,,,,
Limiting the crew to choices presented by the automated guidance function is not a valid implementation of manual flight control.,,,,,0,0,,,,
Safe operation requires accuracy of crew inputs to meet human rating requirements.,,,,,1,0,,,,

"Within the context of this requirement, monitoring is the ability to determine where the vehicle is, its condition, and what it is doing.",,,,,0,0,,,,
Monitoring helps to create situational awareness that improves the performance of the human operator and enhances the mission.,,,,,1,1,,,,
Determining the level of operation over individual functions is a decision made separately for specific space systems.,,,,,0,0,,,,
"Specifically, if a valve or relay can be controlled by a computer, then that same control could be offered to the crew to perform that function.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"However, a crew member probably could not operate individual valves that meter the flow of propellant to the engines, but the function could be replaced by a throttle that incorporates multiple valve movements to achieve a desired end state (reduce or increase thrust).",,,,,0,1,,,,
"The first condition recognizes that the crew performs functions to meet mission objectives and, in those cases, the crew is provided the designated capabilities.",,,,,0,1,,,,
This does not mean that the crew is provided these capabilities for all elements of a mission.,,,,,0,1,,,,

The Gateway shall incorporate a shared data storage system.,,,,,0,0,,,,
The architecture must account for a capacity that considers the modules’ systems data and additional storage capacity that can be accessed and used by the Gateway.,,,,,0,1,,,,

"Rationale: Top-level requirement to provide shared processing for Gateway system functions, imagery, internal robotics, crew health and performance, payloads, etc.",,,,,0,0,,,,
Robot mass and power can be reduced if some of the processing can happen off board the robot.,,,,,1,1,,,,
The Gateway shall provide crew displays and controls that are operable by a crewmember from within any habitable environment.,,,,,0,1,,,,
"Rationale: Crew capability (data/command interfaces) provides monitoring of the C&W as well as nominal and off-nominal control of life support, thermal control, communication, and other system functions necessary for safe operations from any habitable module.",,,,,0,1,,,,
The Gateway shall provide internal lighting for the illumination required for all operational tasks dependent on visible light.,,,,,0,1,,,,
Rationale: A wide range of crew and robotic tasks is expected to be performed within the vehicle.,,,,,0,1,,,,

"Examples of crew tasks include critical inspection and legibility, personal hygiene, telerobotics, and cleaning and maintenance.",,,,,0,0,,,,
"Examples of robotic tasks include inspection, localization, and object identification.",,,,,0,0,,,,
The combined lighting system and architectural layout are a factor in the development of a usable lighting environment.,,,,,0,0,,,,
"During waking hours, lighting systems must provide the crew with retinal light exposure that is sufficient in intensity, optimal in wavelength, and implemented at the proper times and durations to entrain the human circadian pacemaker to a 24-hour day and facilitate schedule shifting.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Effective lighting systems for internal operational environments support human/camera color vision within the appropriate chromaticity range, color accuracy, and allow for control, position adjustment, and glare prevention.",,,,,1,0,,,,
"Effective lighting systems for robotics have similar characteristics, although an additional consideration is the reduction in variations in lighting across locations or time as much as possible.",,,,,0,0,,,,
The Gateway shall illuminate external surfaces <TBR-L2-GW-014> required for all operational tasks dependent on external visible light.,,,,,0,1,,,,
Rationale: Lighting is expected to be poor on the non-sun-facing surfaces of Gateway.,,,,,0,0,,,,
Supplemental lighting is required in order for imagery to be acceptable.,,,,,1,1,,,,
This is needed for EVA situational awareness and will be helpful for EVR operations.,,,,,1,1,,,,

The Gateway shall distribute primary power using two bi-directional power domains to each axial docking port.,,,,,0,0,,,,
The Gateway primary power transmission from the PPE to the Gateway modules utilize bi-directional axial port feeds.,,,,,0,0,,,,

The Gateway shall implement a redundant 16kW bi-directional primary power pass-through to each radial docking port.,,,,,0,0,,,,
The Gateway will provide redundant primary power transmission to each radial docking port to provide the adjoining (docked) Gateway element access to the over-all Gateway primary power.,,,,,1,1,,,,
The bi-directional power transmission to each radial docking port allows element launch order independence with either Gateway HAB element and integrates the Gateway distributed battery system to be able to power the Gateway during eclipses and allows the distributed batteries to recharge.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"The radial docking port primary power system interfaces are redundant, meaning that in case of a single radial docking connector failure, the remaining docking connector has to transfer at least 16 kW.",,,,,1,1,,,,
The bi-directional primary power interface at the radial docking port has been pre-defined and utilizes the high power docking Rectangular Umbilical Connector (RUC) with each high power RUC having one (1) utilized for grounding purposes or spares.,,,,,0,0,,,,
The Gateway shall provide dc-isolation between the Gateway primary power domains and the secondary power domains.,,,,,0,0,,,,
"Rationale: To facilitate Gateway power quality verification without the presence of all Gateway modules and power consuming equipment within an integrated test, the Gateway will provide dc-isolation between the Gateway primary power domain and the secondary power domain of the applicable elements.",,,,,1,1,,,,
This will allow independent power quality verification of all Gateway secondary loads and it will allow independent verification of the Gateway primary power.,,,,,1,1,,,,
Source and load emulators will be required to verify the power quality between power interfaces.,,,,,1,1,,,,
The Gateway shall be capable of operating critical systems off of a single power domain.,,,,,0,0,,,,

"The full range allows for operational flexibility during crewed and uncrewed periods, including response to contingency scenarios and potential reduction of consumables during uncrewed periods.",,,,,1,1,,,,
Pressurized modules have a design pressure for structural design purposes higher than 14.9 psia to account for pressure set points of positive pressure relief valves (PPRVs) and fault tolerance of the ECLS system.,,,,,0,1,,,,

The structural health monitoring system is required to measure responses of the Gateway to actual dynamic loads in order to assess structural life usage vs predicted loads.,,,,,1,1,,,,
Knowledge of life state can be used to modify operations to either add constraints to protect structural life or to reduce un-needed constraints.,,,,,0,1,,,,
"Due to limitations on crew time and other Gateway resources, automated structural damage detection, location, and assessment can be utilized to determine criticality of damage and focus remediation efforts.",,,,,1,1,,,,
The Gateway shall limit atmospheric leakage rate to less than 0.05 kg/day at ambient pressure in isolated module configuration.,,,,,0,0,,,,
Rationale: This leakage rate is consistent with ISS experience and reflects the leakage of multiple elements aggregated on-orbit.,,,,,0,0,,,,
The Gateway shall detect atmospheric leaks greater than <TBD-L2-GW-011>.,,,,,0,0,,,,
"Rationale: Detection of leaks will allow for response and repair, in the event of an atmospheric leak, by the crew or autonomously.",,,,,1,1,,,,

Items to be transferred between Gateway Elements need to be sized appropriately.,,,,,1,1,,,,
The Gateway shall be equipped with passive or active crew exercise equipment isolation systems to reduce induced loads to the primary structure to less than or equal to <TBD-L2-GW- Gateway structure.,,,,,1,1,,,,
The Gateway shall have a Probability of No Penetration (PNP) greater than or equal to for items with the potential to create a catastrophic hazard if impacted or punctured by MMOD.,,,,,1,1,,,,
Rationale: This requirement sets the limit for the probability of no penetration.,,,,,0,0,,,,
This requirement is based upon the ISS PNP requirement for permanent modules.,,,,,0,0,,,,
Area is the outer most surface area of the module and is in m^2 and Time is in years.,,,,,0,0,,,,
Time used for calculation should encompass the expected life of the module.,,,,,0,0,,,,

The Gateway shall provide at least single failure tolerance to catastrophic events.,,,,,0,1,,,,
"Catastrophic hazards that cannot be controlled using failure tolerance may be exempted from the failure tolerance requirements with mandatory concurrence from the Technical Authorities and Director, Johnson Space Center (JSC) (for crew risk acceptance).",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Exemptions from failure tolerance shall be requested in accordance with DSG-RQMT-011, Gateway Hazard Analysis Requirements.",,,,,0,1,,,,
Rationale: Compliance with this requirement can be accomplished at the end item level or through a combination of hazard controls at the Module/System levels and end item level.,,,,,1,0,,,,
A common way to improve reliability and thus meet safety requirements is to use systems that tolerate failures when complete failure avoidance isn’t practical.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"Specific hazard controls and implementation must be derived from an integrated design and safety analysis performed in accordance with DSG-RQMT-011, Gateway Hazard Analysis Requirements.",,,,,0,0,,,,
Acceptance of these approaches by the Technical Authorities avoids processing waivers for numerous hazard causes where failure tolerance is not the appropriate approach.,,,,,1,1,,,,
Additional failure tolerance may be required to meet systems reliability requirements.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"The Gateway shall provide the capability for autonomous operation of system and subsystem functions, which if lost, would result in a catastrophic event.",,,,,1,0,,,,
"Rationale: This capability means that the system does not depend on communication with Earth (e.g., mission control) to perform functions that are required for control of catastrophic hazards.",,,,,0,0,,,,
"While the crew is present, the Gateway should automate catastrophic hazard controls to minimize the need for crew actions, using crew action only as a last resort where automation is not practical.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Rationale: Critical hazards do not require failure tolerance for human-rating, however, critical hazards can have a significant impact on Loss of Mission (LOM) risk.",,,,,1,0,,,,
The Gateway Program will derive the specific hazard controls and implementation from an integrated design and safety analysis performed in accordance with DSG-RQMT-011.,,,,,0,0,,,,
Failure tolerance for critical hazards may be required to meet probability of loss of mission or system reliability requirements (if applicable).,,,,,1,1,,,,
The Gateway shall provide the appropriate failure tolerance capability without the use of emergency equipment and systems.,,,,,0,0,,,,
"Rationale: Emergency systems, EVA or emergency operations cannot be used as a leg of failure tolerance as these emergency systems and equipment cannot definitively prevent an initiating event.",,,,,1,0,,,,
"As a result, the mitigation of catastrophic and critical hazards will implement a FT strategy without the use of EVA, emergency systems, or emergency operations.",,,,,1,0,,,,
"However, the use of EVA, emergency systems, and contingency or emergency operations will be considered a Crew Survival Method (CSM) to prevent Loss of Crew (LOC) in the event all other approved hazard controls have failed.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"The Gateway shall protect redundant systems, redundant subsystems, and redundant major elements of subsystems (such as assemblies, panels, power supplies, tanks, controls, and associated interconnecting wiring and fluid lines) to ensure that an unexpected event which damages one is not likely to prevent the other from performing the functions.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Rationale: Where redundancy is used to satisfy the failure tolerance requirement, this design requirement provides maximum protection from common cause events.",,,,,1,1,,,,
This requirement does not mandate physical separation but physical separation has been a historically demonstrated method to mitigate common cause failures.,,,,,0,0,,,,
"System analysis needs to consider the channelization of all capabilities necessary to manage Fault, Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) including sensors and utility services such as power, thermal and data.",,,,,0,1,,,,
"Rationale: For NASA sponsored end items the risk of human casualty on the ground is limited to less than 1 in 10,000 as required per NASA-STD-8719.14A, Process for Limiting Orbital Debris.",,,,,0,0,,,,
The NASA-STD is a companion to NPR 8715.6 and provides specific requirements and assessment methods to assure compliance with the NPR.,,,,,0,1,,,,
"The principal factors used in calculating the risk of human casualty from uncontrolled reentries include the number of debris expected to reach the surface of the Earth, the kinetic energy of each surviving debris, and the amount of the world population potentially at risk.",,,,,0,0,,,,
The last factor is a function of both the orbital inclination of the space structure prior to re-entry and the year in which the re-entry occurs.,,,,,0,0,,,,
"Extensive human casualty studies by the U.S. Government, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, have examined the probability of injury and/or death from falling debris for a variety of impacting kinetic energies to humans.",,,,,0,1,,,,
A kinetic energy threshold criterion of 15 joules is widely accepted as the minimum level for potential injury to an unprotected person.,,,,,0,0,,,,
"The Gateway shall comply with the requirements in DSG-SPEC-CHP-010, Gateway Program Subsystem Specification for Crew Health and Performance (CHP).",,,,,0,0,,,,
Rationale: DSG-SPEC-CHP-010 includes content decomposed from requirements in DSG-RQMT-001 regarding crew health and performance.,,,,,0,0,,,,

"Mission and volume designers are to carefully analyze volume needs of the crew, crew equipment, storage, trash containment volumes and trash transition plans to ensure they are adequately sized to provide adequate net habitable volume for the crew to effectively and efficiently perform mission objectives.",,,,,0,1,,,,
"Every effort should be made to separate functional areas for activities that could degrade or operationally conflict with each other, particularly emergency response activities, or that produce environmental conditions that are detrimental to mission performance or safety (for example, glare, noise, vibrations, heat, odors, etc.).",,,,,1,1,,,,
Co-location of unrelated activities could degrade operations resulting in increased workload and operational delays.,,,,,1,0,,,,
"Furthermore, traffic flow is not to interfere with other unrelated operational and recreational activities of the crew.",,,,,0,0,,,,
"These activities may include sensitive spacecraft control, routine servicing, experimentation, eating, sleep, and relaxation.",,,,,0,0,,,,
"Similarly, co-location of related, sequential functional work areas can reduce transit time, communication errors, and operational delays.",,,,,1,0,,,,
"For example, food stowage and food preparation areas should be located near one another to minimize the time required to retrieve food for meals and promote group dining for behavioral health benefits; and consistent spatial orientation and visual distinctions such as identifiers and aids can promote effective execution of mission tasking.",,,,,0,1,,,,
"The management of crew nutrition is defined as influencing the design, provision, and operational implementation of in-flight nourishment of crewmembers over the course of the mission to perform Gateway tasks.",,,,,0,1,,,,

"The ability to provide the designated level of care applies to all flight phases, including during pressurized suited operations.",,,,,0,0,,,,
"A medical system provides preventive care, diagnostic care, and medical treatment and must consider any possible in-flight medical need including persistent health conditions.",,,,,0,0,,,,
Additional information on Levels of Care can be found in NASA/TM- System Development.,,,,,0,0,,,,
"To date, there have been multiple illnesses and injuries during all mission phases and, in the absence of adequate clinical capabilities, the likelihood of significant negative impact to mission viability due to crewmember illness or injury is increased.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Because immediate transport to a clinical facility is not an option on-orbit, in flight health care is essential and is optimal with an integrated crew health data system, to support the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of illness and injury.",,,,,1,0,,,,
"An integrated crew health data system aids in the management of crew health in-flight, especially for the early detection and intervention for medical issues.",,,,,0,0,,,,
"During missions with longer evacuation times and mission duration, the management of data, information, and ability for extensible knowledge augmentation becomes increasingly important in order to manage the medical care and wellness of the crew efficiently.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"To aid the crew in basic decision support through automatic organization of data and knowledge augmentation materials (such as medical references), an integrated system should collect, process, and store all crew health-relevant data from various sources (vehicle and ground), in addition to crew task performance data, and make this data available to both the crewmembers and ground support.",,,,,1,1,,,,

Human health and performance optimization tools will require incorporation of vehicle systems data and other CHP systems data in a data management system that will allow for running existing algorithms to inform/predict crew health and performance capabilities.,,,,,0,1,,,,
Incorporating this information into display/informatics systems is critical.,,,,,0,0,,,,
The intent of this specific countermeasures is to align with the phased approach of using Gateway as a proving ground to develop tools for improved crew autonomy.,,,,,0,1,,,,
The Gateway system shall limit cross-contamination between food preparation areas and body waste management and hygiene areas.,,,,,0,0,,,,
Rationale: Limiting the transfer of microorganisms to the food preparation areas protects crew health.,,,,,1,0,,,,
"To properly control the contamination of the food preparation area from the body waste management and hygiene areas, a task analysis must be performed to identify important design factors (i.e. concurrent use of the areas, volume needed at each location to prevent contact, distance between areas, storage and accessibility requirements, etc.).",,,,,1,1,,,,
The chance of cross-contamination can be further decreased by designating body waste management and personal hygiene areas as far away from food preparation areas as possible.,,,,,0,0,,,,

Controlling Human Error requires identification of human errors through human error analysis (HEA).,,,,,0,0,,,,
"The HEA is a systematic approach to evaluate human actions, identify potential human error, model human performance, and qualitatively characterize how human error affects a system.",,,,,0,0,,,,
HEA provides an evaluation of human actions and error in an effort to generate system improvements that reduce the frequency of error and minimize the negative effects on the system.,,,,,1,1,,,,

The Gateway shall provide a stowage system that can be monitored via the IMS.,,,,,0,0,,,,
The stowage system does not include vehicle secondary structure.,,,,,0,0,,,,
The Gateway shall accommodate restraints and mobility aids for IVA operations.,,,,,0,0,,,,

The Gateway shall accommodate EVA capability without blocking access to the visiting crewed vehicle(s) during the EVA.,,,,,0,1,,,,
"Rationale: During prebreathe operations, campout, or if the need arises to depress equipment lock as secondary ingress path, an airlock situated in between the stack and the crewed vehicle isolates IVA crew from the VV or indicates they have to sit in the VV (and may not be able to command Airlock repress from that side).",,,,,1,1,,,,
The Gateway shall provide EVA compatible accommodations to support continuous translation across adjacent (berthed/docked) modules.,,,,,0,1,,,,
Rationale: EVA translation across the Gateway stack is necessary to support both EVA test objectives and contingency EVAs regardless of the status of EVR capabilities.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"Translation aids, such as EVA Handrails, and a path free of obstructions or hazards must be designed to support the movement of EVA crew members between the crew lock and EVA work sites.",,,,,0,1,,,,
Each module is responsible for linking translation paths between modules.,,,,,0,0,,,,
This may result in the need for handrails to be installed around the circumference of the end of each module and/or extending radial towards the end-cone or docking adapter.,,,,,0,1,,,,

The minimum hold time for each burst pressure test shall be 5 min.,0,,,,,0,,,,
NC parent metal used in hazardous systems without additional barriers to leakage may be required by USAF Range Safety and NASA Payload Safety to have a minimum design burst pressure requirement of 4.0 times maximum ground working pressure (MGWP).,1,,,,,0,,,,
"NC parent metal valves used in hazardous systems without additional barriers to leakage are considered Category A ordnance devices and have to follow NASA-STD 8719.24 and AFSPCMAN 91-710, Volume 3, Chapter 13, or equivalent document for applicable range.",1,,,,,0,,,,
This requirement should be identified and documented early in the launch facility coordination process and be documented in the tailoring agreement.,0,,,,,0,,,,
"This requirement would not apply to Category B ordnance pyrovalve applications, which are, by definition, non-hazardous.",0,,,,,0,,,,
CAUTION: An expended (fired) pyrovalve may retain significant pressure in the primer chamber assembly for an indefinite period of time.,0,,,,,0,,,,
"Additionally, if the valve does not fail after 4.00xMEOP, it meets the full safety factor applied to tubing <3.81 cm (<1.5in) in diameter (checklist item 33D).",1,,,,,1,,,,
"Other shear-section barriers, such as a metal-to-metal seal, elastomeric seats, or O-rings, do not provide the same level of confidence and do not meet the intent of this Specification (checklist item 9A).",0,,,,,0,,,,
The internal shear-section shall be a continuous unit of non-welded parent metal.,0,,,,,0,,,,
This pertains to the area of the shear-section around the parent metal barrier that is opened upon actuation of the valve.,0,,,,,0,,,,
The shear-section normally has flanges larger than the shear- section outer diameter that are welded to the valve housing to prevent leakage after actuation.,0,,,,,0,,,,

Investigations have shown that the stringers that may occur in 304L are usually approximately 0.00127 cm (0.0005 in) in diameter and that the stringer material is not attacked by common fuels and oxidizers over a period of several years.,0,,,,,0,,,,
"Even if the stringers are oriented perpendicular to any thin break section, the chances of a leak from stringers are remote.",1,,,,,1,,,,
"However, a commonly used dye-penetrant etchant (a solution of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid) has been shown to dissolve stringer material in 304L stainless steel.",0,,,,,1,,,,
The solution attacks the material in the stringer and can cause leaks in thin sections.,0,,,,,0,,,,
This solution should be avoided on any part of the valves (checklist item 17D).,0,,,,,0,,,,
"Note that, for 304L stainless steel, any significant stringer is screened out during the required proof and helium leak testing process.",1,,,,,0,,,,
The use of vacuum remelt raw material significantly reduces the likelihood of stringers occurring.,1,,,,,0,,,,
"The housing and all other internal material that will be in contact with the hazardous fluids after actuation, e.g., rams, plugs, seals, shall also have the same requirements for materials compatibility with the hazardous fluids and the same welding compatibility requirements (checklist item 18D).",1,,,,,0,,,,
"Before firing, a leak in the upstream-side parent metal seal could allow hazardous fluid at system pressure to enter the ram area.",1,,,,,1,,,,
"Similarly, after firing, leakage past the ram might occur.",1,,,,,1,,,,
"In either case, hazardous fluid could enter the ram area.",1,,,,,1,,,,
"Therefore, to ensure at least single-fault tolerance against external leakage, all internal valve materials that could then become wetted are to be fully compatible with the hazardous fluid.",1,,,,,1,,,,
Specific mission requirements may drive other requirements that are not covered by this Specification.,0,,,,,0,,,,
"For example, some applications require that the valve be in the system and pressurized for many years with corrosive propellants after it operates, causing stress corrosion or metal nitrate formation.",1,,,,,1,,,,
This design is generally considered to contain two inhibits to flow and is the preferred design approach.,0,,,,,0,,,,

Material certifications and traceability records shall be maintained and available.,0,,,,,0,,,,
Parent metal shear-section valves used in single isolation configurations (without additional inhibits) need additional inspection and rigorous analysis to ensure the high unlikelihood that critical flaws exist.,1,,,,,1,,,,
Shear-sections should be cleaned using the standard documented cleaning process for the material (checklist item 24D).,0,,,,,0,,,,
"If applicable, the “V” notch angle, depth, and tip radius shall be measured by optical comparator or equivalent and verified to fully meet drawing requirements and indicate measured tip radius (checklist item 27D).",1,,,,,1,,,,
"It is also recommended that the actual radius be documented to within measurement system accuracy (within ±0.000635 cm (±0.00025 in), traceable to a national standard).",0,,,,,0,,,,
"This specification requires that the valve meet a demonstrated safety factor of 2.5 to 4.0, as applicable.",1,,,,,1,,,,
"Dye penetrants are generally used on flat surfaces (not in sharp groves), are not recommended, and should not be used unless a well-documented probability of detection (POD) study has been conducted to prove that the POD is greater than 90 percent with 95 percent confidence (termed commonly used for other similar applications, such as detecting cracks in critical bolt threads, and could be considered for this application, as long as the technique has been fully validated.",1,,,,,1,,,,
Questions regarding validation should be addressed to the NASA NDE Technical Fellow.,0,,,,,0,,,,
"Welding shall be done on a weld lot basis, using the same weld schedule and weld instructions for a specific weld and be done in a way that minimizes or eliminates “V” notch residual weld stress (checklist item 30D).",0,,,,,0,,,,
This means that the shear-section is to be outside the weld heat affected zone.,1,,,,,0,,,,
"All manufacturing and inspection records and tested units shall be retained by the manufacturer for a minimum of 10 years, unless otherwise specified by contract (checklist item 36D).",1,,,,,1,,,,

"Rationale: Engineering analysis proceeds by separating the engineering design into the components and disciplines, analyzing, or estimating each component of the operation or failure mechanism separately, and recombining the components in accordance with physics and engineering principles.",1,,,,,0,,,,
The methods selected must be supported by appropriate technical rationale and be documented in detail.,0,,,,,0,,,,
Rationale: Commercial items or components should be used when they satisfy the ground systems function and will not degrade the safety or reliability of the ground or flight system.,1,,,,,1,,,,
Requirements should be specified in terms of functionality or performance rather than design.,0,,,,,0,,,,
"To qualify as COTS, equipment must not be modified (see modified off-the- shelf [MOTS]).",1,,,,,0,,,,
"Rationale: In the corrosive marine (sea coast) environment at KSC, the most common sources of corrosion are moisture and sodium chloride.",0,,,,,0,,,,
"The launch-induced environment also introduces hydrochloric acid, which exacerbates the corrosive effects of the marine environment.",0,,,,,1,,,,
Rationale: Criticality of a ground system (GS) is determined by a Safety and Mission Assurance study analysis of the function and application of the equipment.,1,,,,,0,,,,
"The classifications assigned to the GS will guide the design team in determining which specifications and standards to apply, which materials to select, and how to document the GS.",0,,,,,0,,,,
This method is generally employed where qualitative operational performance is to be verified.,1,,,,,1,,,,
"It is the responsibility of the program/project to determine recertification requirements, which may include refurbishment, analysis, or test.",0,,,,,0,,,,
"Facility systems include heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC); 60-hertz (Hz) power; potable water; elevators; lighting; shop air; etc.",0,,,,,0,,,,

Conventional facility systems are not covered by this standard.,0,,,,,0,,,,
"If the factor of safety is defined in terms of stress, it is the ratio of the ultimate or yield stress to the maximum design stress.",1,,,,,1,,,,
"In fatigue design, it is the ratio of the calculated fatigue life to the allowable design life.",1,,,,,0,,,,
"This standards manual specifies the minimum factor of safety for GS for specific structural applications (e.g., pressure vessels, threaded fasteners, and aluminum structures).",0,,,,,0,,,,
Rationale: This definition is consistent between ground and flight hardware.,0,,,,,0,,,,
It reduces to the traditional stress-based definition in the simplest case.,0,,,,,0,,,,
Rationale: Equipment used during the manufacturing of flight hardware is not considered to be GSE.,1,,,,,0,,,,
Each program defines when manufacturing ends and processing of the flight hardware begins.,1,,,,,0,,,,
"If manufacturing equipment is to be used after flight hardware processing begins, it must be designed to meet GSE requirements.",1,,,,,1,,,,
GSE does not include tools that are designed for general use and not specifically for use on flight hardware.,0,,,,,0,,,,
"It does not directly interface with flight hardware, although it may supply commodities, power, or data that eventually reaches the flight hardware after being conditioned or controlled by GSE.",0,,,,,0,,,,
"Rationale: Design standards for GSS may be similar to or, at the discretion of the program/project, identical to the design standards for GSE.",0,,,,,1,,,,
Protective features designed into the GSE prevent failures from propagating to flight hardware.,0,,,,,0,,,,
"Limited-life items require periodic replacement or refurbishment, which must be defined in design and maintenance documents.",0,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: Modification of COTS voids the design intent of the original equipment and places responsibility for performance, functionality, and reliability on the designer.",0,,,,,1,,,,
"The structure supports or provides direct access to flight hardware (e.g., test stands, launch complexes, access platforms in operational or research facilities, towers, and similar special-purpose facilities).",1,,,,,0,,,,
The transition between conventional and nonconventional is the interface between the structure specifically designed for processing and vehicle access and the generic building structure whose purpose is the physical support of the overall facility.,0,,,,,0,,,,
The transition region between conventional and nonconventional structures should be designed to meet the criteria for both types of structure.,0,,,,,0,,,,
This value is marked on the device indicating maximum working capacity.,0,,,,,0,,,,
STE is classified as GSE or GSS and designed to the requirements of this standards manual.,0,,,,,0,,,,
"Rationale: Although its use is limited, STE has the potential to cause damage to flight hardware or injury to personnel.",1,,,,,1,,,,
STE includes equipment traditionally known as shop aids.,0,,,,,0,,,,
It includes measurements taken with certified and calibrated tools in accordance with generally accepted scientific or engineering principles.,0,,,,,0,,,,
"Tools are calibrated, when necessary, in accordance with industry standards.",1,,,,,1,,,,

Their design and general use in industry includes a variety of applications that may be required on flight hardware or GSE.,0,,,,,0,,,,
"Examples of tools include torque wrenches, crow’s feet, voltmeters, go/no-go gages, screwdrivers, wire cutters, and pliers.",0,,,,,0,,,,
"Rationale: Documentation may include the origin of materials and parts and certification of personnel and processes during fabrication, assembly, procurement, installation, activation, verification, and validation.",0,,,,,0,,,,
"Verification may be determined by a combination of test, analysis, demonstration, and inspection.",0,,,,,0,,,,
"In order to meet customer requirements, individual system and equipment design projects may need criteria that are more stringent than those specified herein.",1,,,,,1,,,,
"In such cases, these criteria should be determined by the responsible design organization in consultation with its customers (e.g., users and operators).",1,,,,,1,,,,
Each program/project has the responsibility to define its own policy for the acceptance of commercial-off-the shelf (COTS) equipment in ground systems (GS).,0,,,,,0,,,,
COTS equipment shall be evaluated for acceptability from a materials and processes (M&P) standpoint (see 6).,0,,,,,,,,,
Qualification tests and inspections shall be indicated in the engineering documentation.,0,,,,,,,,,
Modifications to COTS shall be performed in accordance with this standards manual.,0,,,,,,,,,
"COTS equipment should be used to the maximum extent possible when (1) it satisfies the intended function, (2) it will not degrade the safety or reliability of the flight or ground system, and (3) it provides a cost savings that exceeds possible cost increases due to unique maintenance or logistics requirements, modifications, or an increase in the complexity of the interfacing equipment.",1,,,,,,,,,
Vendor or contractor documentation and supporting test data should be incorporated into system control documents.,0,,,,,,,,,
The GS design shall support the program/project-specific operational requirements of flight hardware.,0,,,,,,,,,
"In addition to operational requirements, GS should be designed for ease of production, manufacturing, construction, and inspection.",0,,,,,,,,,
GS should be designed to minimize the complexity and frequency of maintenance.,0,,,,,,,,,
Close manufacturing tolerances should be avoided unless required by design and performance.,1,,,,,,,,,
"GS shall not degrade or contaminate flight systems, other GS, subsystems, or experiments while it is being used, checked out, serviced, or otherwise handled.",1,1,,,,,,,,
"GS design shall include access provisions for handling, servicing, calibrating, maintaining, and replacing components and limited-life items.",0,,,,,,,,,
"GS design should provide for ease of operation, maintenance, servicing, cleaning, and inspection of hardware and software.",0,,,,,,,,,
GS fault detection and isolation should be considered based on criticality and cost of failures.,0,,,,,,,,,
Interfaces should be verified by test and/or analysis.,0,,,,,,,,,
"As a design goal, the number of connections at interfaces should be minimized.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Fluid, mechanical, or electrical connections in close proximity shall be designed to prevent cross-connections.",0,,,,,,,,,
Unique design configurations and clear identification marking should both be used to minimize the probability of incorrectly mating connections.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Design configurations include threads, flanges, sizes, orientation (male/female, left-hand, right-hand), pins, and keys.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Identification marking (see 5.6.1) should indicate function, commodities, pressure, reference designator, etc.",0,,,,,,,,,
GS shall be compatible with all facility interfaces.,0,,,,,,,,,
An assessment may be required to determine whether it is more cost-effective to modify the facility interface or design the GS to meet the existing facility interface.,0,1,,,,,,,,
Some GS interfaces directly to the facility, some GS interfaces to GSS or to facility ground support systems (F-GSS).,0,,,,,,,,
GS shall be designed for the operational life specified by program or mission requirements and identified in design drawings and maintenance documents.,0,,,,,,,,,
Engineering documentation should specify maintenance requirements to meet design life.,0,,,,,,,,,
Existing GS that was verified to meet the GS requirements of a previous NASA program shall be considered acceptable for use without further verification to the requirements of this standards manual.,0,1,,,,,,,,
"GSE requirements for previous NASA programs are defined in SW-E-0002, NASA-STD-5005, SSP 50004, or a previous version of this standards manual.",0,,,,,,,,,
Items with limited life shall be identified on design drawings and annotated with the specific limitation to the life of the item.,0,1,,,,,,,,
Use of items with a projected lifetime that is less than the design life of the GS for which the items are intended should be avoided whenever possible.,0,1,,,,,,,,
Elapsed time or cycle indicators should be employed to accumulate operational time or cycles for limited-life items.,0,1,,,,,,,,
The age of items that are installed in a nonoperating mode should also be tracked.,0,1,,,,,,,,
The colors in Appendix A shall be used for GS designed and painted for NASA/KSC.,0,,,,,,,,,
"If the equipment is COTS, the colors in Appendix A should be used as guidance to make equipment consistent with other GS.",1,,,,,,,,,
"GS should be designed to minimize the probability of system failure and reduce the severity of the failure effect of the system, including failures caused by operator errors and human-system interaction.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Procedures and instructions to perform and document analyses (such as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis [FMEA]/Critical Items List [CIL] or sneak circuit analysis), will be in accordance with KNPR 8720.2.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Redundant systems, subsystems, or components shall be physically oriented or separated such that the failure of one will not prevent the other from performing its intended function.",0,,,,,,,,,
The design of redundant systems shall provide methods for verifying each redundant element without compromising the reliability of the redundant system.,0,,,,,,,,,
Failure tolerance is not possible for primary structure and pressure vessels/tubing in rupture mode.,0,,,,,,,,,
Safety of these systems is achieved by application of design requirements contained in this standards manual.,0,1,,,,,,,,
"More stringent fault tolerance requirements (e.g., two-fault tolerant for loss of flight crew) may be applicable depending on program requirements.",0,1,,,,,,,,
Failure modes/inadvertent operator actions are controlled using a systematic application of approved standards and design margins.,0,1,,,,,,,,
GS may be designed to terminate operations autonomously after the first failure or inadvertent operator action and in time to preclude any scenario that results in loss of life.,0,,,,,,,,,
This approach is consistent with the historical use of the term “fail-safe” in GS design.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Purges, ground special power, and launch release systems are examples of systems that interface with other systems whose loss would propagate failures.",0,,,,,,,,,
Requirements for availability of system functions during launch processing may necessitate fail-operational design.,0,1,,,,,,,,
GS shall be designed such that failures will not be propagated to the flight systems.,0,,,,,,,,,

The business requirements specification process5 has been tailored to the needs in VICINITY as described in D1.1 and detailed for business requirements in this section.,,0,,,,,,,,
From the collected inputs the business requirements are extracted per each vertical domain (Figure .,,0,,,,,,,,
"All business requirements for each vertical domain as described in section 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4, are consolidated and sorted.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Moreover, common business requirements are identified and clustered in separated horizontal fields, as described in section 4.5.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The business requirements will be transformed into technical requirement specification and architectural design, which drives the whole VICINITY solution definition and subsequent implementation.",,0,,,,,,,,
Many requirements have been identified that will need to be fulfilled by VICINITYs proposed architecture and implementation.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The requirements identified in D1.3: “Report on pilot sites and operational requirements”, D1.4: “Report on VICINITY business requirements” and D1.5: “VICINITY technical requirements specification” need to be addressed.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, the results of D1.6: “VICINITY architectural design” also have an impact on the overall model of requirements.",,0,,,,,,,,
The process on how VICINITY will deal with these requirements is depicted in Figure 4: VICINITY requirement structuring process.,,0,,,,,,,,
Partner UNIKL will use the inputs from D1.3 to D1.6 to create a SysML Model of all requirements VICINITY needs to address.,,0,,,,,,,,
This model is on one hand used to track that these requirements are met by the VICINITY.,,0,,,,,,,,
"On the other hand, the model is used during WP6 to check and validate these inputs.",,1,,,,,,,,
"If some proposed requirements cannot be met, either the architectural design or the requirements themselves need to be changed as previously described in section 3.1.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Either way, problems and errors can be identified early in the design process.",,0,,,,,,,,
"A new iteration starts, of which the results are reexamined.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The same happens if during the lifetime of the VICINITY projects, some of the requirements will change.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Not only does this allow validating that all requirements are met, but also which of them may cause or are subject to threats and risk and thus need to be handled with special care.",,1,,,,,,,,
"In a business environment, the BRS describes how the organisation is pursuing new business in order to fit a new business environment for VICINITY, and how to utilize the system as a means to contribute to the business.",,0,,,,,,,,
Each pilot has one or more domain focus - and hence differentiated business requirements.,,1,,,,,,,,
Common assets in a neighbourhood need to be understood in order to identify the value of the assets.,,1,,,,,,,,
"When capacity is high and need is low, the price for sharing is normally low.",,1,,,,,,,,
"When capacity is low and need is high, the prices for sharing will be high.",,1,,,,,,,,
A modern neighbourhood is equipped with a complex range of technical systems.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Interoperable with city IoT infrastructures, like LoRaWAN and NB-IoT.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Optimise sizing, monitoring of space and energy consumption; New rental models for sharing of assets need to be prepared; Standard process for emergency cases need to be adopted and adhered; Standard applications and business models used in telecom IoT infrastructures.",,0,,,,,,,,
Buildings are some of the most expensive assets to operate and maintain used in our cities and urban centres.,,0,,,,,,,,
It was found that building owners and managers see economic value through a potential improvement in efficient usage of resources and optimization of building maintenance as facilitated by IoT and VICINITY.,,0,,,,,,,,
Building efficiency includes not only how and when the resources are used but also how many users need the same resource within the buildings neighbourhood.,,0,,,,,,,,
"A recently conducted study [16] in collaboration with Statsbygg, the Norwegian State Property owner, reports that a standard university building has an average energy cost optimization potential of about 15 – 20 % of the total energy cost.",,0,,,,,,,,
"However, a lack of visualisation of consumption of resources and lack of accountability prevents these savings to be made.",,1,,,,,,,,
"IoT gives the property-owner a high-resolution multichannel information-window, making possible to optimise the use of considerable resources inside the building as well as between buildings (cross assets) within a neighbourhood both virtually and physically.",,1,,,,,,,,
"As grids reach maximum use capacity or reach its exploitation limit, the importance of load management increases.",,1,,,,,,,,
"To be able to trade between buildings and grid owners, working markets with load pricing, as well as load shedding and shifting prices must be in place.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Facility managers and grid owners should support to interoperability between various IoT assets (i.e. load flexibility and constraints) that are needed for load management across various building (e.g. devices, charging station) and energy assets (such as RES, batteries,), to be able to trade loads in practice.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Transport: parking space occupancy, parking space prices payments.",,0,,,,,,,,
Collecting and storing data related to people’s behaviour in buildings should be governed by transparent contracts and happen in accordance with relevant rules and regulations.,,0,,,,,,,,
Encryption and/or aggregation of data to protect identities where relevant.,,0,,,,,,,,
A modern building is usually equipped with a vast and complex range of technical system.,,0,,,,,,,,
A communication flexibility and information architecture that can handle the speed and heterogeneity of current and future technical developments is needed.,,1,,,,,,,,
"The managers need incentives to share data from buildings, parking spaces, local grids, such as reduced peak loads, rent on parking spaces or sales of locally produced energy.",,0,,,,,,,,
Availability of IoT based tools with simple management will change how facility management as a service can be delivered.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Dynamic systems, flexible to interconnect or extended various services and devices together, are expected to replace legacy systems.",,0,,,,,,,,
IoT technology provides opportunities to obtain a new basis for digital data in the building industry.,,0,,,,,,,,
"This basis gives us completely new opportunities for monitoring, classification, analysis of the use and performance of a building and thus new opportunities for control and management.",,0,,,,,,,,
Access to such data will change many of the existing business models and will push forward many new models and new types of services.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Facility owners, tenants, building managers should be supported in measurement and visualisation of the interior conditions and parameters to understand the resources consumption and their effects on wellbeing.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The facility owner, tenants and building managers should be supported in measurement the resource usage and / or occupancy to optimise resource maintenance or identify situations required manual or automatic intervention.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Aggregated energy consumption patterns of equipment usage can be offered to the building owners and managers, providing an opportunity to understand the impact of EV charging within a building and manage the process in an economic way avoiding peak consumption.",,0,,,,,,,,
The service providers should have access to devices utilisations to be able to customise the device operation and maintenance leading towards “appliances as a service model”.,,1,,,,,,,,
"The facility owners, managers and tenants should have access to information of activities and resource consumption in order to identify and optimise the buildings operative parameters.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The facility owners, managers and tenants should have access to an overview of registered activities and resource consumption, in order to identify areas in actual need of cleaning, thus reduce the energy consumption and minimise the wear on other parts of the building.",,1,,,,,,,,
The Energy sector has a high strategical value and there are high expectations as to potential impact of the IoT within the industry as a whole.,,0,,,,,,,,
"IoT overall and VICINITY as one of the particular solutions is expected to help in achieving RES energy penetration targets, energy efficiency goals and decarbonisation of economies on the high level, while increasing visibility of processes and improving quality of data resulting in higher quality of services.",,0,,,,,,,,
The Energy ecosystem approach on the municipal level adapted by VICINITY is expected to facilitate data sharing and visualisation of impact on various stakeholder entities.,,0,,,,,,,,
Continuous energy consumption monitoring and control should be supported by interoperability across standards and vendors of the connected devices.,,0,,,,,,,,
Energy consumption systems should addresses functionality that extends beyond energy load balancing during peak periods (periods with high energy consumption).,,0,,,,,,,,
The need for continuous monitoring through system analysis and integration in the building environment should also contribute to the data analysis.,,0,,,,,,,,
Such services would open for B2B solutions and a B2C spectrum of services where a common platform could support the increasing in level of services driven by similar logic and approach.,,0,,,,,,,,
Management energy source across different standards and appliances’ vendors enables management of various sources of production (electricity and heat) and sinks (consumption/ uses of energy) to meet demand as smoothly and sustainably as possible.,,0,,,,,,,,
Management of energy sources should be supported by interoperability across standards and vendors of the connected devices.,,0,,,,,,,,
Establishing and visualising the process of managing a wide range of occasionally used supplies and sinks enables create new business opportunities and add flexibility to the use of electricity.,,0,,,,,,,,
Management of intermittent supplies and sinks should be supported by interoperability across standards and vendors of the connected devices.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Create Interoperable and secure IoT systems to facilitate and form the building blocks of supply and demand management systems, including: in-home communication between smart appliances and energy management systems; and integration to grid operators as well as auxiliary service providers.",,0,,,,,,,,
The Synergies with other systems in buildings should also be incorporated in the energy management system (e.g. water).,,0,,,,,,,,
Many resources provided within a building consume electricity in addition to the appliances and other devises.,,0,,,,,,,,
Interdependencies of one resource consumption and the impact on the other resource are not well understood.,,0,,,,,,,,
Increasing interoperability in consolidating this information is expected to create positive synergies.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Consumers with a B2C relationship will need “a system which should learn the user's preferences and optimize automatically without the need of user interaction.” To achieve this, hybrid fully- automated systems enabled by IoT solutions should be designed, demonstrated and tested.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Engaging consumers in both sectors, businesses and households to manage, produce and store energy and other available resources.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Ownership of data and information about ownership, access, and other related information about the device, should be made available for improved data management and transparency when installed.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The data in question could be e.g. heartbeats, value, volt detection, device ID code, registered ownership, placement etc.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Energy consumers would be anticipating potential economic gains, while transitioning from passive to active energy monitoring.",,0,,,,,,,,
"This also increases energy efficiency, because with advice the users might achieve a better rational use of energy, benchmark designed performance and actual performance of systems.",,1,,,,,,,,
"They are willing to give data access to service suppliers and intermediaries but have concerns as to: their privacy, level of data protection that can be guaranteed and the security of their data.",,0,,,,,,,,
Energy consumers should provide access to data in secure and privacy-preserving way.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The facility owners and managers should be supported in monitoring of energy production/ consumption and facility resource occupancy and/or utilization and heat production over various devices in order to be able to improve the understanding of production, consumption and utilization and provide an opportunity to optimize billing for renters.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The facility owners, managers and tenants should be supported to measure, cluster and visualise of the energy and water consumption of devices to provide an opportunity to do assessment of alternative models of management reduce resource consumption and systems substitution decision making.",,1,,,,,,,,
The data owners should be supported to share available weather data to energy producers from scientific equipment providing them an opportunity to optimise their renewable energy production.,,1,,,,,,,,
"EV charging enabled parking place may be booked by facility owners, thus offering the ability to manage energy production and consumption (demand-response) as well as EV charging utilization to facility owners and/or managers, to identify smooth positive and negative peaks in the electrical energy consumption of buildings taking into account energy price, parking place occupancy plan and price.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The facility owners should be supported in optimization of parking space, EV Charing utilization and management of energy production and consumption.",,0,,,,,,,,
The household owners should be supported with information on resource consumptions and demand response services providing them opportunity to improve energy efficiency of their households and/or improve usage of excess renewable energy.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Plans for solar panel cleaning based on condition of soiling as opposed to periodic cleaning, could be offered by solar panel operators in order to improve panels’ quality of service and reduce costs for cleaning.",,1,,,,,,,,
Solar panel operators should be supported in soiling monitoring.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Facility owners, manager and tenants should be supported to benchmark progress/compliance towards reaching energy efficiency targets with and without energy audits.",,0,,,,,,,,
Sharing more data via VICINITY would increase the visibility of processes and enhance data quality resulting in better quality of services which might lead to higher financial returns in a medium to long term period.,,1,,,,,,,,
Knowledge sharing at municipal level as well as increased competitiveness through deployment of new systems are positive drivers for early adopters.,,0,,,,,,,,
"A lack of internal resources, lack of commitment from the management, and regulatory compliance issues complicates this further, such that data protection and security by design will be a key driver.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The transport sector is recognised by a large amount cross-domain technologies and standards within fields such as road side technologies, car-to-car communication, car-to-road communication, tunnel technology, smart traffic light, smart signs etc.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The transport sector covers all means of logistics, being on the ground, rail, at sea or by air.",,0,,,,,,,,
This is commonly part of ITS (Intelligent Transport System).,,0,,,,,,,,
"Solutions that offer a foundation for exchanging information between systems, opens for many opportunities.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Transportation technology can be considered the life blood of smart cities, as areas that suffer from pressure on the infrastructure reduce green areas, residents’ quality of life and financial status of the affected areas.",,0,,,,,,,,
It is in this context that VICINITY focus on smart parking technology for demonstration purposes.,,0,,,,,,,,
Smart parking is based on optimising the usage of areas in and around the parking facility.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Not just based on available space, but also on specifications that ranges from particular needs and demands to scheduling, environmental considerations, accessibility, security/privacy issues to available services.",,0,,,,,,,,
"For a more in-depth analysis and descriptions, see Annex II: Transport – market and demands.",,0,,,,,,,,
Further descriptions of requirements for the transport domains are listed below.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Parking sites should abide to legislation for ownership models, income from rental, privacy6 and security7 agreements regarding access and authorisation to indoor parking sites8.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Contracts that define responsibilities for ownership of parking space, access and personal data should be defined.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Transaction and rental models should be introduced for long term, short time, subscription based and contract based usage.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Agreements should adhere to standards 9used for exchanging (semantic) data with ITS equipment, traffic control centrals, nearby vehicles, and digital signs.",,0,,,,,,,,
Support for standardised communication protocols used for smart parking and relevant equipment needs to be anchored on a contractual level.,,0,,,,,,,,
The European standard DATEX II should be the preferred choice.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The common rules in the field of data provision and publication are based on this standard, and it is the basics for public procurement and apply for all smart parking detection technologies, payment terminal and other transactions, traffic information and control centres data work.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The encryption and storage of data, should adhere to EU's Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC2 as well as national legislation.",,0,,,,,,,,
This includes anonymising person data and other information that can identify an individual.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Integration with other transport related sectors – most notably car sharing and public transport should also be supported in order to establish the foundation for a healthy ecosystem, and also alleviate some of the pressure on the infrastructure, thereby reducing the climate footprint.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Support and access to updated information on available EV charging stations with technical information, current status and availability, should be supported.",,0,,,,,,,,
Different ways of getting access – in particular to underground garage facilities – should be defined.,,0,,,,,,,,
"This would include authorisation equipment and systems like camera systems for reading licence plates, car based sensor, card reader, RFID, Bluetooth, geo fencing and biometric systems.",,0,,,,,,,,
Other reader/detection units might be integrated when deemed necessary.,,1,,,,,,,,
Demands on user experience design should be an integral part of the solution.,,0,,,,,,,,
"This should address devices and accessibility, in particular with an emphasis on supporting unified design.",,0,,,,,,,,
Certain disabilities and lack of previous experience might affect the usability aspect.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Especially users on that handles the parking experience on small devices need to be receive specific attention, as there is little or no time for training, and the systems will be based on a on-demand approach.",,0,,,,,,,,
This is even more important when the mobile devices will offer interaction with 3rd party services that will be built on top of the parking experience.,,1,,,,,,,,
User experience should be continuously measured and evaluated by UX designers through anonymous tracking of user navigation on the panel.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Access to and visualisation of structural plans/layout for garage facilities should be included in the information about access points, charging stations, fire extinguishers, escape exists, alarm signals as this is necessary in order to provide a proper service that can be implemented and expanded on a longer term.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The transport domain contains challenges within areas such as logistics (e.g. assignment, allocation, optimising routes, history).",,0,,,,,,,,
"Transportation does also include such topics as authorisation/ authentication/access, integration of other services and visualisation of complex information.",,0,,,,,,,,
"This means that proper knowledge of priorities, special requirements for vehicles and users, historical data and ownership of transport related equipment and services will be one of many parameters that will influence logistics and other outcomes from the transport related issues.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, Interoperability on these areas including other value added services should be supported.",,1,,,,,,,,
Interoperability on rulesets that support actions based on changing values and their relevance to the transport domain should be supported.,,0,,,,,,,,
"This includes data from manual booking, trigger mechanisms based on rulesets integrated with other domains (i.e. eHealth and building), request from technical or health care personnel, ground based sensors and visual data from other sources.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The Technical Specification standard CEN 16157-6:2013, Annex D (Data Dictionary), describes DATEX II data exchange specifications for traffic management and information, of which part 6 deals with Parking publication.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Standardisation of DATEX II establish a basis for common exchange between the traffic and the travel information sector, thus opening for cross-domain value-added services.",,1,,,,,,,,
This standard serves for setting out the rules for parking management and should be part of the common framework for handling smart parking related activities.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Camera with Automatic Licence Plate (ALR) detection and reading capabilities affect authentication and authorisation processes, and is part of the entrance security system.",,0,,,,,,,,
This operation also provides the facility owners and managers with information about how many and what registered vehicles that are present at any time.,,0,,,,,,,,
Detection of parking space occupancy could be applied to optimisation of both short-term and long- term parking space usage.,,0,,,,,,,,
These data can also be when correlated with data from ALR-detection and hence improve parking services processes.,,1,,,,,,,,
The health sector is one of the core areas to be included to and benefit from the concept of smart cities.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Under the context of the VICINITY project, two health related scenarios were studied during the requirement analysis process; assisted living at home and preventive medicine.",,0,,,,,,,,
"In order for the demonstrations to be tested appropriately and effectively, a set of specific business requirements should be defined and followed.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Multiple sensors, mainly in the form of wearables but other activity tracking sensors as well, will provide several real-time health condition measurements by monitoring patients’ behaviour, ideally taking into account the “sensitivity” of health related data, a number of other challenges arises regarding ownership and usage of data, security and privacy, trust of authorized third parties and legal challenges as well.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Moreover, concerns regarding trust in data origin are principal business inhibitor.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, a business requirements framework is necessary for the case.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, as the demonstrations run in municipality level, the participating municipality should ensure the involvement of the necessary healthcare personnel.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The devices involved should be low cost and effective, in terms of measuring and tracking as many health conditions as possible but also in terms of ease of use.",,0,,,,,,,,
The right balance among the latter factors will guarantee a decent amount of potential active participants.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Complex, inefficient devices might lead users to reduce their level of participation or even completely abandon them.",,1,,,,,,,,
"As authorised third parties will have access to user’s personal data – especially in case of emergency, the user should have a fully-detailed, complete picture of who and when accessed his/her data.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, an effective audit management mechanism should be introduced.",,1,,,,,,,,
"As users’ personal health data will be shared to authorized third parties, trust is a major concern.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, contracts defining ownership of data, usage of data and privacy should be introduced.",,1,,,,,,,,
Miscommunication is a major issue to be addressed in all domains.,,0,,,,,,,,
"However, it is of even higher importance for Health domain where any missing information could prove crucial.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, a common interoperability “language” should be defined in order to overcome linguistic barriers that could lead to possible misconceptions.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The latter could be achieved by following equivalent integration profiles such as IHE, HL7, DICOM and Continua.",,0,,,,,,,,
"As one of the deployment scenarios, specifically assisted living at home, might possibly involve emergency incidents triggered by the participants, especially the elderly, a standard process of specific steps should be identified to serve the case.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Ideally, the latter should be an override mechanism that follows “break the glass” principles.",,0,,,,,,,,
The suggested framework should be accepted by all sides involved and strictly followed by authorised third parties.,,0,,,,,,,,
Access to health status and in-house conditions could be provided to caretakers for identifying abnormal behaviour with the supervised person.,,0,,,,,,,,
Affordable devices used for condition assessment using could be made available to elderly citizens and caretakers.,,0,,,,,,,,
Caretaker should have access to smart drug dispense usage statistics to be able to detect abnormal drug usages.,,1,,,,,,,,
Simple wearable devices should be supported for elderly people when their ability to operate smart phones or other technical equipment are limited.,,1,,,,,,,,
Household appliances usage data could be offered to healthcare providers in order to identify abnormal behaviour in elderly citizens’ households.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Weather data from scientific equipment to municipalities could be shared by providers, hence municipalities may recommend maximum time of sun exposure to citizens.",,1,,,,,,,,
Information about the perceived temperature due to the influence of wind speed and air humidity could be offered to citizens.,,0,,,,,,,,
This section includes business requirements identified for cross-domain applicability.,,0,,,,,,,,
It builds upon the findings presented in the domain specific requirements.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Younger population expect to have same user experience regardless of different type of mobile devices and wearables used, however different type of devices might have different set of features.",,0,,,,,,,,
Elderly people expect use simple and affordable wearable devices while their ability to operate smart phones are limited.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Building owners, managers and tenants expect that VICINITY enabled system should be operated by youth segment that needs special care, however are able to handle tasks.",,0,,,,,,,,
This would potentially create inclusion into the job market of the fastest growing special care group.,,0,,,,,,,,
Business domain owners expect cross-availability of IoT data that removes vendor locks from IoT eco systems.,,0,,,,,,,,
The ontologies should be extensible to provide semantic interoperability for new devices.,,1,,,,,,,,
Caretaker and elderly citizens expect to use affordable VCINITY enabled devices.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Affects use case: UC 1.1.2.5, UC 1.1.2.6, UC 2.4, UC 2.5, UC 2.6, UC 2.7, environment to allow for third parties services building for demonstration purposes.",,0,,,,,,,,
Concept of the solutions will be considered in D1.5 VICINITY Technical specification requirements and D1.6 VICINITY Architecture design.,,0,,,,,,,,
European Commission introduced the EU Data Protection Reform and adopted the Regulation processing and storing of the personal and sensitive data.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Moreover, the regulation defines concepts of how the data protection should be maintained in the organisation processing private data.",,0,,,,,,,,
Requirement consent 11as described in the Data Protection directive no.,,0,,,,,,,,
Security functional requirements need to be defined for each potential threat.,,0,,,,,,,,
Selection of the functional requirements need to balance the cost of the security measure and cost of potential security breach.,,0,,,,,,,,
The actor should have authorization to access the assets managed or facilitated by VICINITY.,,0,,,,,,,,
Authorization should be managed by the organization connecting to VICINITY.,,0,,,,,,,,
Action performed in VICINITY should be traceable to actor who performed the action including evidence that it has been done so.,,0,,,,,,,,
The unsolicited access or operations in high-volumes can cause unavailability of the part or whole system.,,1,,,,,,,,
Each of these security threats needs to be addressed by one or several security measures to minimize the security risk to acceptable level.,,1,,,,,,,,
"After Mile Stone 1 – “VICINITY requirements, barriers, pilot surveys and audits available”, the requirements will be implemented into a tool (SysML) for easy definition and maintenance.",,0,,,,,,,,
"IoT ecosystems generate data that can be harvested to provide novel commercial services, or public services for the benefit of society.",,0,,,,,,,,
This review was designed to identify benefits and issues related to data sharing both within a single domain and across domains.,,0,,,,,,,,
Achieving interoperability across domains is a key objective of VICINITY.,,0,,,,,,,,
"In the context of VICINITY, interoperability is the ability of a system or a product to work with other systems or products without special effort on the part of the customer.",,0,,,,,,,,
"In order to collect and analyse business drivers and barriers in the context of IoT interoperability, a survey was conducted using a questionnaire to interact with stakeholders and visit to the pilot sites demonstration VICINITY solution.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The scope of the survey included several separate vertical domains (buildings, energy, transport and health) and several horizontal cross-domains (legal & ethics, security & privacy and the technical domain).",,0,,,,,,,,
"Barriers which are similar across domains were identified, along with some more domain- specific ones.",,0,,,,,,,,
The potential for cross-domain synergies was identified which could maximise the use of clean energy and/or optimise the management of resources.,,0,,,,,,,,
"According to several stakeholder studies, security and privacy are some of the most common barriers to the interoperability of IoT.",,0,,,,,,,,
Other barriers identified are lack of standards and low level of product maturity from customer standpoint.,,0,,,,,,,,
There are many IoT ecosystems with actors that operate within cross-domain areas.,,0,,,,,,,,
"These ecosystems generates big data that could be harvested to provide novel commercial services, or services for the benefit of society.",,0,,,,,,,,
"In many case the owners of these data sources are unwilling to share access to their data, especially if they do not have a business case, which enables them to benefit directly from the new services derived from their data.",,1,,,,,,,,
"At this stage of project development VICINITY system´s perceived strengths by the stakeholders in general are as follows: “Interoperability and integration of various standards and protocols which would allow for broad use of the product, allowing for rapid innovation”.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The system is expected to provide efficient, time saving performance and value-added services from a business perspective, while minimising environmental impact and yielding cost savings.",,0,,,,,,,,
The overall goal of VICINITY is to deliver improved quality of life and open for innovative services that can be built on top of the architecture being offered by solution.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Among weaknesses, resistance to change can be expected from strong market players with existing proprietary products.",,0,,,,,,,,
"On consumer side, potential loss of privacy and security, compatibility, complexity and legislation are voiced as potential weaknesses.",,0,,,,,,,,
"These strengths and weaknesses identified from stakeholders’ interactions also known as drivers and barriers are analysed in vertical domains energy (section 4.2), health (section 4.4), transport (section and building (section 4.1) and horizontal domains (section 4.5) legal & ethics, security & privacy domain.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Stakeholders perceive VICINITY as a project, which has the potential to integrate various disparate standards and protocols.",,0,,,,,,,,
This report constitutes one of the components of the VICINITY project.,,0,,,,,,,,
The approach and philosophy employed by VICINITY takes into consideration stakeholders’ opinions in order to build solutions focused on meeting their requirements whilst tackling issues they have identified.,,1,,,,,,,,
The deliverable uses information derived from the representative list of stakeholders and pilot site operators.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Further deliverables in Work Package 1, such as D1.5 and D1.6, will identify functional and technical requirements, resulting in a system architecture, thus completing the knowledge base upon which the VICINITY solution will be developed, tested, deployed and demonstrated.",,1,,,,,,,,
This annex will be used in development of concrete business plans that will look to maximize the exploitation potential of identified assets results as well as address stakeholders’ needs and expectations.,,0,,,,,,,,
Exploitation Strategy and Business Plan Development (WP9 Task 9.5) will monitor and compile the partners’ exploitation activities and seek maximum synergies from them.,,0,,,,,,,,
One major part of the exploitation planning will be the identification of potential target groups and business cases based on the outcome of the project.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Moreover, market requirements and future application areas will be captured.",,0,,,,,,,,
Each exploitable result’s related target group will be identified to make sure each target group is informed about the relevant information / activities within the project.,,0,,,,,,,,
Definition of both individual & consortium exploitation/business/financial plans for each exploitable result.,,0,,,,,,,,
"An annual report will detail exploitation status and perspectives, at partner’s and Consortium’s levels.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The results will be presented in D9.5 in two issues of the document during the second half of the project (M24, M36 and M48).",,0,,,,,,,,

"The core of the smart parking case is to offer interoperability of various suppliers to demonstrate how to provide the same service, with a specific focus on real time occupancy and transaction data in the standard data format DATEX II.",,0,,,,,,,,
Smart parking is a concept that can be assigned for different kind of areas.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Examples like sites near apartments, parking sites near work places or public buildings, parking sites on industrial areas or for commuters, sites for disabled people, indoor sites, outdoor sites, street based parking sites, road side parking, parking sites for cars or trucks, electrical vehicles (EVs) can be envisioned.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Parking space is a resource that is on-demand, and where is usually is a shortage.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Different uses have different needs, either because of the vehicles, or because of disabilities or other concerns with the passengers/drivers/owners.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Cost efficiency is an issue, and introducing parking space sharing, as it makes it possible to ensure that neither private nor public parking sites are left with unused space.",,1,,,,,,,,
"At the same time it makes it possible to exploit areas that otherwise would have been assigned for a specific usage, as real time information about vacancy opens the door for temporarily assigning the parking space for other purposes.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The situation today is that city managers and agencies, municipalities and counties, governments, site owners and other of the key actors referred to in “Table 4: Key actors in smart parking ecosystem” are experiencing pressure from commuters, residents and their own departments to reduce congestion and improve the conditions of those who are dependent on cars or are living in cities.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The mobility sector affects all city users; commuters, business owners, blue light agencies and other departments that are triggered in emergency situations.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Smart mobility solutions, of which smart parking is a part, is considered being a way of solving some of these challenges.",,0,,,,,,,,
"By allowing people to receive relevant data, the user is enabled to make more choices that are informed.",,1,,,,,,,,
"This provides them the option of deciding how to ride, when and where to ride.",,1,,,,,,,,
"It opens for integration from different domains, and facilitates efficient movement of goods and people, thus ensuring logistics supporting the city.",,1,,,,,,,,
These are often owners of the parking sites and are responsible for assigning budgets and managing the criteria that governs cities and infrastructure.,,0,,,,,,,,
The departments that will benefit the most are located in these governmental bodies.,,0,,,,,,,,
"They spend many resources on transporting people and goods, and health care personnel and blue light agencies represent a large part of their budget.",,0,,,,,,,,
Solutions that will assist in reducing the pressure on the operational agencies will have a large impact and therefore gain a lot of interest.,,1,,,,,,,,
Personnel responsible for managing mobility solutions within cities.,,0,,,,,,,,
These are the key buyers in the smart mobility domain.,,0,,,,,,,,
"City Managements are coming congestion, improve the quality of life of those living and working in cities.",,0,,,,,,,,
These are companies involved in data collection and interpretation to provide traffic management solutions to City Management.,,0,,,,,,,,
These are the key sellers and potentially the innovators and integrators in the smart mobility domain.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The products produced by companies operating in this sector aim to optimise parking, improve safety and reduce congestion and emissions.",,0,,,,,,,,
Companies who manufacture technology related to traffic and parking management solutions.,,0,,,,,,,,
These are the innovators within the smart mobility domain.,,0,,,,,,,,
Their products are primarily aimed at companies involved with Transport Information Integration and with City Management.,,0,,,,,,,,

"These are a small, but growing player in the industry offering services to commuters in need of parking space.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Their smart mobility products are aimed at making transport more sustainable, greener and safer.",,0,,,,,,,,

"Companies involved in this sector provide services such as beds, food, fuel, transportation to commuters.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Commuters are informed of available services before, during or after their commute, through the use of smart technology which recognises their route or current location via GPS.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Commuters are targeted by tailored advertising techniques depending on their mode of transport, location or smart phones setup of companies or services which could strike a chord with commuters in that location.",,0,,,,,,,,
Revenues provided by advertising companies could greatly reduce the cost of development and installation of smart transport solutions for city management.,,0,,,,,,,,
Companies whose technology will be used to relay data to transport information from advertising companies.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Additional means of communication (data to and from measuring devices, transport information integrators and advertising companies) will be required.",,0,,,,,,,,
Sensors that can detect occupancy of a parking space needs to send real time data.,,1,,,,,,,,
A gateway will have to be able to transmit the information further into the network.,,0,,,,,,,,
Information must be accessible to interested parties through relevant platforms.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Additionally other sources of feedback, most notably smart light and monitors displaying information will improve usability factors and reduce risks for occupying the wrong parking space, or drive in the wrong direction.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Real time transactions and security and privacy issues related to initial authorisation, authentication and access will have to be integrated in the smart parking system.",,0,,,,,,,,
"This opens for other challenges that needs to be addressed; Who are responsible for handling authorisation and access, who will be liable for parking/damages or theft when occupying parking space.",,0,,,,,,,,
Who will handle payment or other kind of transactions that function as transferring value.,,0,,,,,,,,
How to handle long term and short- term ownership/rental of parking space – and customisation that may take place without consent from other owners.,,0,,,,,,,,
"How to handle booking and verification, rating and other activities that directly may influence the worth of a given parking space.",,0,,,,,,,,
"This may be considered even more important for underground parking facilities, where the entire facility may be affected by choices that are made in regards to just one parking space.",,0,,,,,,,,
Finally – the core part of smart parking is based on optimizing the usage of areas in and around the parking facility.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Not just based on available space, but also on specifications that ranges from disabilities to time slot, from location of entrances to nearby services.",,0,,,,,,,,
Smart parking will offer cross-domain support through interoperability supported through the VICINITY platform.,,0,,,,,,,,
"An extensible core information model, i.e. core ontology, should be used for all information elements to be interpreted, being agnostic of their specific contexts and communication standards.",,0,,,,,,,,
Domain-specific information elements have to be interpreted using specific model extensions of the core model.,,0,,,,,,,,

Level of Review: This material has been technically reviewed by expert reviewer(s).,,0,,,,,,,,
"This document is created under the project-level agreement (PLA) (PLA FY09_G1M.02-02v1) for “New ATM [air traffic management] Requirements—Future Communications” and addresses concepts of use (ConUse), system requirements, and architecture for the proposed L-band (960 to 1164 MHz) terrestrial en route communications system.",,0,,,,,,,,
NAS-level and similar level international concept of operations (ConOps) driving this ConUse and its associated requirements include the RTCA “National Airspace System Concept of Operations and Vision for the Future of Aviation” (Ref.,,0,,,,,,,,

"A process recommended in the “NAS System Engineering Manual” (SEM, Ref.",,0,,,,,,,,
The following subsections summarize the steps taken in developing the ConUse.,,0,,,,,,,,
The Next Generation Air/Ground Communications (NEXCOM) system requirements document (Ref.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The resulting operational problems, if not addressed, could lead to service degradation and could limit introduction of new or expanded services.",,1,,,,,,,,
"These, in turn, could potentially compromise safety of operation and increase operating costs.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Saturation of the very high frequency (VHF) spectrum is the problem specifically mitigated by the introduction of a new L-band system (L–DACS), while the other operational problems will likely be mitigated to a degree dependent on the particular technology implemented with the L–DACS.",,0,,,,,,,,
It is important to note that the FAA’s Data Communications Program (Data Comm) FPR document recognizes that “the scope of the mission shortfalls identified herein [is] broader than will be addressed solely by a data communications capability” (Ref.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Because of the limitations and constraints of implementing data communications using VDL Mode 2 over a congested aeronautical VHF band, FAA Data Comm Program will focus on implementing the certain critical air traffic services.",,1,,,,,,,,
This provides opportunities for L–DACS systems to augment Data Comm by enabling communications of other critical and essential air traffic services to address the shortfalls listed.,,1,,,,,,,,
The Data Communications Networks Services (DCNS) A/G data communications system being developed under the Data Comm Program is expected to precede L–DACS implementation.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Even though each of the shortfalls listed are meant to be addressed to some extent by the Data Comm using VDL Mode 2, there are opportunities to overcome these shortfalls to a greater extent during the later program segments of Data Comm (e.g., late Segment 2 and Segment 3) using link technologies such as L–DACS with greater bandwidth capabilities, which could augment the benefits already attained through VDL Mode 2 Data Comm program segment implementations (i.e., Segments 1 and 2) by providing a broader scope of services.",,0,,,,,,,,
L–DACS will be designed specifically for data communication.,,0,,,,,,,,
It may also target one or more unmanned aircraft system (UAS) communications services.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Additional interference research and testing will determine if any operational constraints are to be imposed, such as limiting the number of users, time of the day, duration, etc.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Data Communications Segment 3 requirements, including full four-dimensional trajectory-based operations (TBO), the L–DACS is also envisioned to support other future communications applications including mobile SWIM and UAS safety-critical data communications, UAS command and control, and monitoring of UAS onboard sense-and-avoid and automation capabilities.",,0,,,,,,,,
COCR services previously identified as potential applications (Ref.,,0,,,,,,,,

"Services provided on airport surface only (e.g., Software Loading, SWLOAD) as well as those likely to be provided in the ENR and TMA domains are included in the table.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Some of the services listed would be mostly provided the ground, while others may be applicable to wheels-on- and off-the-ground scenarios.",,0,,,,,,,,
A key NAS operational concepts source driving the L–DACS ConUse is the RTCA NAS ConOps.,,0,,,,,,,,
"When discussing an impact of introducing the new L-band system, it should be emphasized that the proposed L–DACS is designed to augment current operations and is not intended to replace any of the existing services.",,1,,,,,,,,
The proposed system is expected to further increase safety and efficiency of current operations.,,0,,,,,,,,
An introduction of the proposed L-band system should require no changes to the existing L-band services operating in the same band by utilizing inlay technology and/or other interference mitigation techniques.,,0,,,,,,,,
A “middle-out” approach was adopted to identify high-level requirements applicable to L–DACS.,,1,,,,,,,,
"In parallel with that process, a bottom-up assessment included existing requirements provided in relevant documents such as the NAS SR–1000, the COCR, the Data Comm performance requirements, and documents associated with specific potential applications identified in Task 6.",,0,,,,,,,,
"It further identifies services that are not planned to be implemented by the Data Comm program through Segment 3, and identifies them as possible candidates for implementation via C-band and/or L-band DACS.",,0,,,,,,,,
"It must be stressed that both C-band and L-band DACS are being developed for the FCI to accommodate safety and regularity of flight services and designed to operate over aviation-protected spectrum, so any COCR ATS service could be could be implemented via one or the other of these links (as appropriate).",,0,,,,,,,,

Concepts identified in the document are found applicable for the proposed L–DACS even though it is likely to be implemented beyond 2020–2025.,,0,,,,,,,,
The identified NAS ConOps were then traced to the desired functionality of the proposed network.,,0,,,,,,,,
"These functions are grouped into appropriate functional hierarchies, and functional requirements are derived.",,0,,,,,,,,
The table presents the mapping of NAS ConOps to L–DACS functional requirements and proposed capabilities.,,0,,,,,,,,
This encompasses a top-down approach to the development of functional requirements.,,0,,,,,,,,
Mapping the proposed services to the desired system capabilities and functional architectures presents combined functional requirements from the top-down and bottom-up approaches.,,0,,,,,,,,
An L–DACS physical architecture can be derived from and represents a technical solution to the functional architecture and requirements.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The ground infrastructure comprises a number of L–DACS ground radio stations, each providing a cell-like coverage service volume, and which are geographically situated to provide overlapping coverage (using different frequencies) to achieve seamless service volume handovers.",,0,,,,,,,,
Each ground radio station would be connected to a G/G network through a ground network interface (number 1 in Figure ES–2).,,0,,,,,,,,
The components would be responsible for providing the functions identified in Appendix B and meeting L–DACS functional and performance requirements identified in Section 4 of this document.,,0,,,,,,,,
Most of the identified high-level functional and performance requirements cannot be readily allocated to the components shown in Figure ES–2.,,0,,,,,,,,
More specifically defined ConUse and associated scenarios would make it more appropriate to further decompose the requirements and allow allocation of specific requirements to specific architecture components.,,0,,,,,,,,

Multiple documents related to ConUse and ConOps of the future data communication systems exist.,,0,,,,,,,,
This section provides background information related to ConUse and requirements development to offer the appropriate frame of reference and to provide traceability to better define the scope of this report and its place in the family of concepts documents.,,1,,,,,,,,
ConUse are part of a hierarchy of concepts documents that capture concepts related to the NAS.,,0,,,,,,,,
"As defined in the FAA’s NAS System Engineering Manual (SEM), there are two general types of concepts documents associated with system engineering in the NAS: ConOps and ConUse.",,0,,,,,,,,
"A ConOps is “a description of what is expected from the system, including its various modes of operation and time- critical parameters,” whereas a ConUse is “an extension of a higher level ConOps with an emphasis on a particular NAS system and its operating environment,” (Ref.",,0,,,,,,,,
These three levels can be summarized as follows (from Ref.,,0,,,,,,,,
NAS-level ConOps are a high-level narrative of the user community’s desired change with some performance indicators.,,0,,,,,,,,
The document indicates from the user’s perspective the desired end state for respective systems in the NAS.,,0,,,,,,,,
It often uses various operational scenarios to illustrate the desired operational concept.,,0,,,,,,,,
Service-level ConOps provide conceptual insight into a particular service of the NAS.,,0,,,,,,,,
"It is more detailed and substantial, but it is still expresses the user’s needs regarding a specific system within the NAS.",,0,,,,,,,,
NAS-level and similar international ConOps driving this ConUse and its associated requirements include the RTCA’s “National Airspace System: Concept of Operations and Vision for the Future of Aviation” (Ref.,,0,,,,,,,,
"At the next lower layer, EUROCONTROL’s “Operating Concept of the Mobile Aviation Communication Infrastructure Supporting ATM beyond 2015” (Ref.",,0,,,,,,,,

"L-band (960 to 1164 MHz) communications system named the L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (L–DACS), providing services similar in scope to those described in the “FCI Aeronautical Data Services Definition Task Report” (Ref.",,0,,,,,,,,
This follows from the previous FCS technology evaluation studies (Ref.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Because many, if not most, NAS systems are not new, but rather, evolutionary improvements of existing NAS systems, a top-down process is not always appropriate.",,1,,,,,,,,
"This is a combination of a top-down process, which takes into account new concepts and missions needs, and a bottom-up approach, which takes into account existing requirements and concepts.",,0,,,,,,,,
"As shown in the figure, operational concepts and requirements of higher-level concepts documents flow down to this document, providing high-level guidance and direction in the form of required functions and flows for the services of interest, namely A/G and A/A communications services.",,0,,,,,,,,
"In addition to this top-down process, a bottom-up process of identifying and evaluating specific concepts and requirements developed for other communications systems, such as Data Comm, Next Generation Air/Ground Communication (NEXCOM), and Link2000+, along with appropriate NAS System Requirements (SR–1000), was employed for this document.",,0,,,,,,,,
"A process recommended in the NAS system engineering manual (SEM, Ref.",,0,,,,,,,,
The following sections describe the findings for each of the steps shown in the figure.,,0,,,,,,,,
This section defines the operational needs for the L–DACS by describing current and planned A/G communications systems and their associated problems and capability shortfalls.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Though not a current system at this time, the planned data communications networks services (DCNS) A/G data communications system being developed under the FAA’s Data Comm Program is discussed here because its initial implementation is expected to precede L–DACS.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Data Comm should mitigate many of the current A/G operational problems and shortcomings, while still leaving room for L–DACS to provide additional gains over current shortcomings.",,0,,,,,,,,
The current A/G Communications System for ATC consists of voice-based networks that use DSB–AM radios and operate in the 117.975 to 137 Megahertz (MHz) VHF band for civil aircraft and the 225 to 400 MHz UHF band for military aircraft.,,0,,,,,,,,
The radios operate with the same frequency used for controller-to-pilot (uplink) and pilot-to-controller (downlink) transmissions in a simplex “push-to-talk” mode.,,0,,,,,,,,
"In the event of a control facility power loss, engine generators provide back- up power.",,1,,,,,,,,
"In the event of equipment failure, A/G communications are provided by Backup Emergency Communications (BUEC) in the Enroute, Emergency Communications System (ECS) in the large TRACONS and portable transceivers in the smaller TRACONS and Air Traffic Control Towers (ATCT).",,1,,,,,,,,
The current A/G communications system architecture is roughly the same for all operational environments.,,0,,,,,,,,
The specific equipment used in the A/G communications string can differ among the various facilities.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Different control facility types have different voice switches, with each type of switch having a unique interface.",,0,,,,,,,,
Appendix A of the NEXCOM system requirements document (Ref.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Communications enables the NAS to exchange information with users, specialists, ATC facilities, and other Government agencies.",,0,,,,,,,,
This information is transported over land lines and wireless connectivity utilizing government and commercial assets.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Communications defines how data is moved across the NAS to accomplish flight planning, control functions and navigation services for ground and space based systems.",,0,,,,,,,,
This enabler provides end-to-end service to pilots to include disseminating and coordinating the flight plan and defines how controllers provide service throughout the flight while coordinating with other facilities and government agencies.,,0,,,,,,,,
The communications enabler supports collaboration between users and specialists for traffic synchronization and flow services.,,0,,,,,,,,
Communications support the exchange of navigation and surveillance information across the NAS.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Information includes electronic signals emanating from ILS, VOR and space based systems and aircraft transmitted beacon code data.",,0,,,,,,,,
An “x” at a row-column intersection in the table indicates that the particular function in that row is needed to provide the NAS service capability in that column.,,1,,,,,,,,
Of particular interest for this report are the functions that can be enabled by A/G communications to provide specific NAS service capabilities.,,0,,,,,,,,
"For example, A/G communications is used to implement some of the functionality needed to manage flight plans in support of the flight planning service capability.",,0,,,,,,,,
This A/G communications-specific mapping is indicated by the blue boxes in the table.,,0,,,,,,,,
TO NATIONAL AIRSPACE SERVICE (NAS) SERVICE CAPABILITIES (REF.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Based on the need to support the NAS critical services, A/G voice communications latency and availability performance requirements are fairly stringent.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Typically, this has resulted in requirements for 0.99999 availability and an end-to-end latency of 250 msec3 for the most critical voice communications services.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Voice communications is used for all phases of flight, that is, from gate to gate.",,0,,,,,,,,
The users of the current VHF A/G communications system include the following (Ref.,,0,,,,,,,,
NAS service capabilities and performance requirements listed in Section 3.2.2.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Currently, they are characterized by “high availability, low end-to-end latencies, the ability to convey human feelings, flexibility of dialogue, provision of a party-line, and use for non-routine, time critical, or emergency situations” (Ref.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Some of these characteristics actually offer an advantage to voice communications as compared to data communications; however, there are several disadvantages of voice communications that motivate the need for data communications for many applications.",,0,,,,,,,,
This is usually not a problem for A/G communications in continental airspace with manned aircraft.,,0,,,,,,,,
"However, this imposes a constraint to the routine operation of UAS in the NAS.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Even though the UAS operate under a Certificate of Authorization to allow flight in the NAS, UAS often currently operate in beyond line of sight conditions using non protected frequency bands (i.e., not AM(R)S or aeronautical mobile satellite (route) service (AMS(R)S frequency bands).",,0,,,,,,,,
Other operational constraints for UAS are described in Section 6.0.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The resulting operational problems, if not addressed, could lead to service degradation and limit introduction of new or expanded services.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Though the FAA Data Comm Program employing very high frequency digital link (VDL) Mode 2 technology is expected to mitigate these shortcomings to a considerable degree (as described below), saturation of spectrum is highlighted in red as the problem specifically mitigated by the introduction of a new L-band system (L–DACS).",,0,,,,,,,,
In addition it is likely that L–DACS will provide additional relief to the technology limitations of voice communications by providing broadband service capabilities not possible with VDL Mode 2.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Unfortunately, as shown in Figure 8, the current A/G communications system lacks data communications capability for ATS.",,0,,,,,,,,
"In moving towards NextGen, this shortcoming will become more acute and could lead to several significant shortfalls in safety, capacity, efficiency, and productivity.",,1,,,,,,,,
"As part of the investment analysis process for Data Comm, a fairly comprehensive list of these shortfalls was developed.",,0,,,,,,,,
These are repeated in Table 2 to specifically identify the shortfalls that the Data Comm intends to address.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Because of the limitations and constraints of implementing data communications using VDL Mode 2 over a congested aeronautical VHF band, Data Comm will focus on implementing the most critical ATS services not requiring extensive amounts of bandwidth.",,1,,,,,,,,
"This provides opportunities for L– DACS systems to augment Data Comm by enabling communications of other critical and essential ATS services, including those requiring greater bandwidth, to address the shortfalls listed in Table 2.",,0,,,,,,,,
Peak communication workload demands on the radar controller take a larger portion of the controller’s available cognitive resources.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Situations conducive to producing errors, confusion, and read-back and hear-back errors arising from voice congestion and voice communication quality.",,0,,,,,,,,
Inability to implement a coherent “sector resource management” concept for the sector team where air/ground communication workload can be shared.,,0,,,,,,,,
Alternate means to enable air/ground communication support for contingency plans when the primary voice communication capability is not available.,,1,,,,,,,,
"For example, when a catastrophic event results in the loss of air/ground voice communication at an air route traffic control center (ARTCC) or during transient events such as a “stuck microphone” in the cockpit.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The capability to rapidly and accurately communicate complex clearances containing multiple latitude/longitude-defined route elements, such as those associated with high-altitude airspace design; arrival and approach procedure names; and, speed, altitude, and heading instructions and preferences.",,0,,,,,,,,
The ability to more effectively manage inter- and intra-facility sector air/ground voice communication transfer.,,0,,,,,,,,
The ability to efficiently communicate air traffic instructions such as altimeter settings and aircraft beacon codes.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The ability to disseminate efficiently, airspace congestion and weather advisories; and NAS infrastructure status information.",,0,,,,,,,,
The ability to efficiently communicate complete departure clearances and revisions necessitated by traffic management initiatives.,,0,,,,,,,,
The ability to provide for the maximum efficient use of the airspace and strategic plans by adjusting individual flights to reduce contention for resources and assure no resource is allowed to remain idle in the face of demand.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Limited ability to use four-dimensional trajectories associated with flight objects and the airspace plan to identify areas of congestion, and the potential need for flow control initiatives to mitigate severe congestion.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Lack of the ability to support airspace user operational requirements, utility, performance, and other flight operations preferences.",,0,,,,,,,,
Avionics and airframe manufacturers need consistent global communication capabilities requirements.,,0,,,,,,,,
Lack of the ability to exchange user preferred trajectories in real time.,,0,,,,,,,,
"There are limited decision support tools to communicate and ensure user preferred routing, integrated sequencing, and spacing of arrivals and departures in Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) airspace.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Absence of synchronization between onboard avionics, such as Flight Management Systems, with ground Flight Data Processing Systems.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Lack of synchronization between airborne and ground-based ATC increases controller and flight crew workload, imposes additional communications requirements, and introduces risks of operational errors and incidents.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Providing for synchronization between aircraft flight management systems and ground-based ATC data processing systems provides increased predictability for flights and will allow aircraft operators to reduce costs, optimize flight routes, improve utility, and reduce dependency on voice communications.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Misaligned communications infrastructure and service delivery to meet anticipated growth in the number of sectors and areas of specialization that must be supported for a given airspace combined with the high cost for hiring additional/maintaining current controller staff, leads to smaller and smaller sectors thus increasing flight crew/controller workloads and increased cost.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Currently, air/ground communication capabilities are not integrated with other aspects of the automation environment.",,0,,,,,,,,
Instructions to and requests from airspace users must be independently exchanged via voice air/ground communications and then manually updated in automation systems such as the flight data processor leading to system errors and less efficient movement of aircraft through the airspace.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Inability to handle multiple, simultaneous traffic management initiated trajectory changes is limited to single voice transmissions that are prone to miscommunications and may lead to system errors.",,1,,,,,,,,
Inability to automate many repetitive and time-consuming tasks precludes labor resources from focusing on more productive tasks.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The current communication system lacks the capabilities inherent in modern, network-based communications and therefore limits more efficient dynamic resource management.",,,1,,,,,,,

"This section presents a top-down determination of functional requirements through: (1) a functional analysis based on prior work, and (2) a functional analysis based on the ConUse defined in Section 3.0, and an analysis of appropriate NAS–SR–1000 requirements.",,,0,,,,,,,
A functional architecture can interpreted as a hierarchical arrangement of functions and interfaces that represents the complete system from a performance and behavioral perspective (Ref.,,,0,,,,,,,
"For its top-down functional analysis, this report leverages prior functional analysis work to characterize aeronautical A/G and A/G communication.",,,0,,,,,,,
Appendix C presents a hierarchical decomposition of functions as diagrams and in an outline format derived from Reference 8.,,,0,,,,,,,
Functional architectures can be presented in several different ways.,,,0,,,,,,,

"An operational performance assessment (OPA) begins with required communication performance (RCP) and allocates these requirements to humans and technical components (e.g., equipment).",,,0,,,,,,,
The term required communication technical performance (RCTP) refers to the allocation to the technical components.,,,0,,,,,,,
The performance requirements resulted from the OPA conducted as part of the COCR.,,,0,,,,,,,
"That OPA determined the performance a system or service must achieve and led to determination of the availability, integrity, and transaction time requirements.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Performance requirements were driven by operational needs and safety requirements as well as other assessments (e.g., information security) to determine overall communication performance requirements.",,,0,,,,,,,
The more stringent of the safety objectives and operational requirements for each parameter were used to determine the communication performance requirements.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The operational requirements were driven by the type of exchange (e.g., trajectory change and general information) and the domain in which the service was offered.",,,0,,,,,,,
Values in Table 15 are based on COCR ATS FRS performance requirements (Ref.,,,0,,,,,,,
"For example, the WAKE service is a driving service for defining the latency requirements in the airport, TMA, and en route domains.",,,0,,,,,,,

TABLE 19.—MAPPING OF ITU PRIORITY LEVELS TO COCR SERVICES (REF.,,,0,,,,,,,
These are additional AOC services not specified in the COCR and therefore not addressed in the ITU Informational Paper ACP– WGF 19/IP01 as all other services.,,,1,,,,,,,
"A fundamental safety requirement is that a new system shall not cause a degradation in safety when compared with the existing A/G (or A/A, as applicable) communications system.",,,0,,,,,,,
Preliminary safety and security analysis and the associated requirements are covered in a separate document (Ref.,,,0,,,,,,,
The L–DACS architecture can be characterized at many levels.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In accordance with U.S. Government policy, all Government agencies, including the FAA, have developed an enterprise architecture (EA).",,,0,,,,,,,
"Of most relevance to this report is the NAS EA, which relates to activities that support operational air traffic services.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The NAS EA contains architecture products and views that describe the current NAS “portfolio” of infrastructure and services, the 2025 far-term and 2018 mid-term target architectures, and roadmaps to reach the target architectures.",,,0,,,,,,,
Some examples of the NAS EA views have been depicted in Section 3.0 of this report.,,,0,,,,,,,
System elements are presented depicting their functionality.,,,0,,,,,,,
"A/G communications is shown as an enabler of various NAS services facilitating surveillance, weather, flight management, and other data exchange.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The L–DACS architecture, as it matures, may be incorporated into the NAS EA.",,,0,,,,,,,
The high-level L–DACS architecture presented in this document might serve as a high-level entry point for EA incorporation.,,,0,,,,,,,
"It should be d, however, that the FCS technology assessments leading to candidate technologies recommendations were conducted before formal system requirements, ConUse, and architecture were developed.",,,0,,,,,,,
"As such, the development of L–DACS candidate technologies: L–DACS1 and L–DACS2, to a certain extent, might dictate a reverse-engineering approach to be taken for developing the proposed system architecture to assure traceability in the technology selection process.",,,0,,,,,,,
It is recommended that this approach be considered as part of future U.S. and European coordination activities in the L–DACS technology downselection process.,,,0,,,,,,,
At least one iteration of that process has been completed and is reflected in the FCS technology assessment reports.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Another aspect of synthesis—“translating the requirements, as set in context by the functional architecture, into the design architecture, consisting of the physical architecture with its associated technical requirements” (Ref.",,,0,,,,,,,
It represents “a hierarchical arrangement of hardware and/or software components along with associated interfaces depicting the physical definition of the system.,,,0,,,,,,,
Lower level Functional Analysis work is constrained by a higher level physical architecture” (Ref.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The ground infrastructure comprises a number of L–DACS ground radio stations, each providing a cell- like coverage service volume, and which are geographically situated to provide overlapping coverage (using different frequencies) to achieve seamless service volume handovers.",,,0,,,,,,,
Each ground radio station would be connected to some G/G network through some ground network interface (GNI) (no.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The components shown in the figure, with the exception of the ground station infrastructure (e.g., power, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), and antenna towers), would be responsible for providing the functions identified earlier and meeting L–DACS functional and performance requirements identified in Section 4.0.",,,0,,,,,,,
This architecture is necessarily presented at a high level because the L–DACS ConUse so far are very broad in scope.,,,1,,,,,,,
Most of the high-level functional and performance requirements identified in Section 4.0 cannot be readily allocated to the components shown in Figure 26 and Figure 27.,,,0,,,,,,,
The main attributes of the current UAS would apply to the proposed system as well when services are provided over the L–DACS and as such are detailed below.,,,1,,,,,,,
Most current UAS are equipped with line-of-site (LOS) control data links.,,,0,,,,,,,
"However, such systems will still require LOS control data links.",,,0,,,,,,,
The level of reliance on the LOS system is reflected in the level of control data link redundancy and low latency adopted by different UAS.,,,0,,,,,,,
Most pilot in-the-loop takeoff and landing UAS use dual redundant data links and have low pilot-control-input-to-pilot-observable-response latencies since the pilot is actively maneuvering the aircraft in real time.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Conversely, pilot on-the-loop systems often only have single-thread LOS data links and higher latencies because the pilot is not in real-time control of the takeoff or landing maneuvers.",,,1,,,,,,,
Dual redundant LOS control data links offer the advantage of having two sets of data link equipment significantly improving the overall mean time between failures (MTBF) of the data link.,,,0,,,,,,,
The two links can also offer improved data link availability.,,,0,,,,,,,
"For example, if one of the links is temporarily suffering degradation, because of interference or propagation-related effects, then the other link in a different frequency band could take over the delivery of telecommands and telemetry, because interference and propagation effects are not correlated for the two links.",,,1,,,,,,,
Some current UAS are equipped with BLOS UA control systems.,,,0,,,,,,,
"While most takeoff and landing activity is controlled using the LOS systems, at a manufacturer-specific altitude or range, the UAS is switched from LOS to BLOS control and is usually flown this way for the bulk of the distant flight activity.",,,1,,,,,,,
The pilot using the LOS system to control the aircraft does not necessarily have to be the same pilot controlling the aircraft using the BLOS system.,,,0,,,,,,,
A LOS system will again be used for landing but not necessarily the same one that was used for takeoff.,,,0,,,,,,,
This allows the UA to make landings at distant locations and also allows for pilot relief.,,,1,,,,,,,
"To enhance link availability when using satellite communications, current UAS that fly BLOS missions often utilize two or three different satellite communications systems, all operating in parallel.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Typically, the flight computer on the aircraft and the computer in the control station simultaneously monitor all links and choose, on a real- time basis, the best link as appropriate.",,,0,,,,,,,
This link choice can also be manually controlled by the pilot.,,,0,,,,,,,
The proposed L–DACS will not offer BLOS communication, these links will remain satellite-based.,,,0,,,,,,
Not all current UA carry voice communication equipment.,,,0,,,,,,,
Current UA that are equipped only for LOS flights often have their VHF voice transceivers located in their control stations.,,,0,,,,,,,
"This is adequate when the control-station based VHF transceiver can maintain voice communication with the controlling ATC entity; however, for BLOS operation this is unacceptable.",,,1,,,,,,,
"In current BLOS UAS, the voice traffic is carried (along with the telecommands and telemetry) as part of the overall data link between the control station and the aircraft.",,,0,,,,,,,
Most of the VHF voice equipment currently used for both LOS and BLOS systems is standard equipment covered by current technical standard orders (TSOs).,,,0,,,,,,,
"However, the method for monitoring the voice traffic between the pilot and the VHF equipment, when it is carried by the aircraft flying a BLOS mission, is not specifically covered by current regulations.",,,1,,,,,,,
It should be d that while the proposed L–DACS could support voice communication only data communication was planned over the L-band for manned aircraft.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Typically, given the statistical nature of the situation, the data links will return to full functionality.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The amount of time a particular UA can operate without its data links is dependent on its design and level of autonomy, but after a certain amount of time without a data link all systems must declare that the link is lost.",,,0,,,,,,,
The vast majority of UA have built-in procedures to accommodate lost link situations.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Again, the level of autonomy plays a major part in what the UA does after losing its link, but in most cases the aircraft will fly a preplanned maneuver trying to reestablish any data link that might be available while making its way to a precoordinated location where it can be picked up again by the LOS system located at that facility.",,,1,,,,,,,
Transponder- equipped UA may set their transponders to squawk certain codes as part of their lost link procedure.,,,0,,,,,,,
Lost link procedures will need to be developed for the proposed L-band system.,,,0,,,,,,,
Current UAS Spectrum Usage includes a wide range of frequency bands for control of the UA.,,,0,,,,,,,
Systems operate on frequencies ranging from VHF (72 MHz) up to Ka-band (27 to 40 GHz).,,,0,,,,,,,
"The factors driving the choice of frequency are related to limiting the size, weight and power of the airborne data link equipment—particularly antennas and power amplifiers—as well as data rates required.",,,0,,,,,,,
Many BLOS systems share the control link and the payload return link on one common carrier so the wide bandwidth needs of the payload return link may drive this choice more than the lower data-rate needs of the control link.,,,0,,,,,,,
Spectrum provision for CC is essential for the safe operation of UA and their integration in the NAS.,,,0,,,,,,,
Appendix E discusses UAS spectrum requirements for the proposed L–DACS.,,,0,,,,,,,
Appendix F contains the details of the L–DACS applicability to UAS applications.,,,0,,,,,,,
"They include aerodynamic control messages, power plant control messages, and messages associated with changing the status of the avionics (e.g., frequency of the VHF ATC radio) or aircraft (e.g., raise and lower the landing gear).",,,0,,,,,,,
The first type of information relates to the flight characteristics of the UA.,,,0,,,,,,,
"This data includes items such as position, flight trajectory, altimeter setting, altitude, heading, speed, route clearance, and arrival time.",,,0,,,,,,,
The pilot uses this data to maintain full awareness of the flight of the UA and to determine the changes needed to ensure safe flight.,,,1,,,,,,,
The second type of information relates to the health and status of UA.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Health and status data provides critical information about the condition of the subsystems, sensors, and hardware of the UA.",,,0,,,,,,,
The pilot at the control station uses this information to maintain full awareness of the ability of the UA to function and to diagnose problems.,,,1,,,,,,,
The pilot can then handle potential or actual problems by taking preventive measures or corrective actions to ensure continued functioning and thus safe flight.,,,1,,,,,,,
The third type of information relates to situation awareness data.,,,0,,,,,,,
This type of data describes the operational environment of a UA.,,,0,,,,,,,
Examples of this data are weather conditions and terrain information.,,,0,,,,,,,
It seems likely that the messages associated with those services will need to be relayed to and from the pilot via the UA.,,,0,,,,,,,
The types of messages discussed above apply to the proposed L-band system.,,,0,,,,,,,
"As d earlier, voice communication is not currently considered for the manned aircraft applications and therefore was not the focus of prior FCSs.",,,1,,,,,,,
The capacity of the CC links used on current UAS is proprietary to the link manufacturer.,,,0,,,,,,,
"However, a survey of publicly available literature indicates that data rates ranging from 1200 bps to 200 kbps are successfully used today to control UA.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Currently, UAS use in the NAS is restricted to operating under a certificate of authorization, providing it a special waiver for conducting a flight in the NAS.",,,0,,,,,,,
ATC separation assurance—Air traffic control is responsible for safe separation of all aircraft.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Classes A, B, and, if the UAS is operated in accordance with instrument flight rules (IFR), Class C.",,,1,,,,,,,
Segregated—A defined volume of airspace reserved for exclusive use of a particular user.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Need for Change and Impact on Existing Unmanned Aircract System Operations Application of UAS is anticipated to increase over the next decade and beyond, ranging from small local surveillance aircraft to large, unmanned, transoceanic freight carriers.",,,0,,,,,,,
These systems offer low-cost alternatives to manned aircraft applications and present numerous applications opportunities.,,,0,,,,,,,
"At the same time, the volume and variety of systems pose new challenges to the airspace management and ATC infrastructure.",,,0,,,,,,,
Challenges associated with the addition of unmanned aircraft vary from those similar to manned aircraft to UAS specific.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Various performance characteristics and different moving patterns—manned aircraft typically go from one location to another, UAS may stay over one location for an extensive period of time—may affect existing NAS operations.",,,0,,,,,,,
"This, in turn, would affect departure and arrival and ATC procedures including A/G and A/A communication.",,,0,,,,,,,
A relatively high rating was assigned to a lower part of the L-band (960 to 1024 MHz).,,,0,,,,,,,
"Control and contingency functions cut across the boundaries of all three basic functions (aviate, navigate, and communicate).",,,0,,,,,,,
"The control functions involve data and information exchange between the UA and control segments of UAS, networking, data bus protocols, and related issues covering internal data and information exchange within a UAS segment.",,,0,,,,,,,
Contingency functions involve procedures or programmed operation that provide for a predictable behavior in the event of system failure such as loss of control link.,,,0,,,,,,,
The proposed communication system should be designed and implemented to support a seamless integration of UAS operations into current ATC procedures while maintaining the required safety-of- flight levels.,,,1,,,,,,,
"For communicating with ATC, the UA will use the same equipment as a manned aircraft.",,,0,,,,,,,
The link will provide a two-way communication between the CS and the UA.,,,0,,,,,,,
The uplink will be used to send commands to the aircraft for navigation purposes.,,,0,,,,,,,
This is the command link that would probably necessitate low data rates.,,,0,,,,,,,
The downlink will be used to send the flight status of the UA to the remote pilot.,,,0,,,,,,,
It is anticipated that in some flight conditions or in specific airspaces it could be necessary to downlink video streams.,,,1,,,,,,,
Such a requirement could lead to data rates of several hundreds of kbps per UA.,,,0,,,,,,,
Control communications will have to be compliant with ICAO standards to be further specified on this function.,,,0,,,,,,,
The system will support a two-way communication between the remote pilot and the UA.,,,0,,,,,,,
The downlink from the UAV to the CS or remote pilot will provide an indication that the function operates as desired.,,,0,,,,,,,
The necessity to send video streams must be considered avoiding duplication between command and control and sense-and-avoid video downlinks.,,,0,,,,,,,
Payload applications such as the downlinking of surveillance data for non-safety purposes were excluded from the scope and not considered in estimating nationwide CC bandwidth requirements or evaluating candidate spectral bands.,,,0,,,,,,,
Both commercial and Government applications could be provided over the L-band system.,,,0,,,,,,,
Example operational scenarios for each type of application are presented in Table 20.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Earth science and geographic missions (e.g., mapping and surveying or aerial photography) and biological and environmental missions (e.g., animal monitoring, crop spraying, volcano monitoring, biomass surveys, livestock monitoring, or tree fertilization) Coastline inspection, preventive border surveillance, drug control, anti-terrorism operations, strike events, search-and-rescue of people in distress, public interest missions (e.g., remote weather monitoring, avalanche prediction and control, hurricane monitoring, forest fires prevention surveillance, insurance claims during Famine relief, medical support, aid delivery.",,,0,,,,,,,
A follow on research is documented in the Preliminary Draft New Report ITU-R M.[UAS-BANDS- EXIST-ALLOC]: Frequency band study to support control links for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) (Ref.,,,0,,,,,,,
The document s the highly favorable physical properties of the L-band for UAS control links.,,,0,,,,,,,
Negligible rain losses and low free-space losses should permit reliable long-range LOS communication between relatively low-power radios using omnidirectional and medium-gain antennas.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In additional to propagation characteristics, smaller UA whose size, weight, and power (SWAP) budgets do not allow the use of satellite terminals would also benefit from a small size of omnidirectional antennas suitable for airborne use in this band.",,,1,,,,,,,
It appears feasible for UAS CNPC [Control and non-payload communications] to share 12 or more megahertz of spectrum in this band without depriving existing systems of needed spectrum.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Such an allocation would not be sufficient to meet all the spectral needs of UAS CNPC, but it would furnish small UA with badly needed access to protected spectrum and would provide UA of all types with the band diversity that is essential for reliable pilot-to-UA communications.",,,0,,,,,,,
It is recommended that larger UAs be equipped with a terrestrial link capability wherever possible.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Latency will be of the utmost importance when establishing a safety case for the operation of UAs, particularly in non-segregated airspace.",,,,1,,,,,,
Current air traffic management relies heavily on voice communications although information via data links is being progressively implemented.,,,,0,,,,,,
Hence new operational requirements for the future data link environment will also need to be developed (Ref.,,,,1,,,,,,
"In the future, in some parts of the world, the number of these vehicles may represent a large portion of an Air Traffic Service Unit’s (ATSU’s) traffic load.",,,,0,,,,,,
"When providing ATS to a UAS, this may involve the relay of communication and execution instructions to and from a remote pilot; however, operational performance requirements between an ATSU and an UAS remain the same as those between an ATSU and any manned aircraft.",,,,1,,,,,,
It should also be d that UAS vary widely in their design and capabilities.,,,,0,,,,,,
A human pilot is always in control of an UA while it is operating.,,,,0,,,,,,
UAS complies with ATC procedures and instructions while in ATC.,,,,1,,,,,,
Prevention procedures are in place for unauthorized assumption of control.,,,,0,,,,,,
Security of the control and communication links between the UA and control station is provided.,,,,0,,,,,,
UAS communication link is compatible with other communication systems.,,,,0,,,,,,
A notional system architecture consisting of three segments and the associated internal and external interfaces are shown in Figure 30.,,,,0,,,,,,
The detailed description as well as notional diagrams of each segment can be found in RTCA DO–304 (Ref.,,,,0,,,,,,
L-band communications system research and development.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Due to changes in the proposed European partners’ schedule, some of the activities planned to be completed and detailed in this document were not included in this task.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Specifically, further interference analysis and the development of a joint interference testing program have been postponed until corresponding European L-band activities resume.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Additionally, refinement of the upper layers of the L–DACS1 protocol stack has been postponed.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Inputs to Design Specifications are limited to the outputs from the previous analyses presented in the ConUse, System Performance Requirements and Architecture sections of this document and the L-band System Engineering Preliminary Safety and Security Risk Assessment and Mitigation (Phase I deliverable 7–2D, Ref.",,,,0,,,,,,
EUROCONTROL/FAA Teleconferences were held on a regular basis as part of the Task 7 scope.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Updates to the L-band system research and development schedule, as appropriate, are included in this document.",,,,0,,,,,,
The proposed band is to be used for an L–DACS for terrestrial en route communications as part of the FCI.,,,,0,,,,,,
"This assignment assumes a co-allocation on a noninterfering basis with Aeronautical Radio Navigation Systems (ARNS) in the same band, primarily distance measuring equipment (DME).",,,,0,,,,,,
"Consequently, further interference studies and technology analysis are required to assure compliance with this requirement.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Because of fewer VHF spectrum depletion concerns in the United States than in Europe for A/G communications, L–DACS development in the United States was determined to be a lower priority compared with the other future communications components, with L-band technology mainly considered to support far-term applications.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Because system capacity and spectrum saturation in the VHF aeronautical communications band appears to be a more pressing issue in Europe, the need for an L-band system is more prevalent in that region.",,,,1,,,,,,
"As such, FAA has assumed a support role to the EUROCONTROL efforts in respect to the L-band activities.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The first FY2009 NextGen milestone activity d above will be met with the deliverables provided under Task 7, including this document, by developing L–DACS ConUse, requirements, and architecture for potential domestic en route applications in the NextGen timeframes.",,,,0,,,,,,
This document will serve as part of the second milestone activity.,,,,0,,,,,,
Its full execution will be postponed and will depend on the EUROCONTROL L-band system development plan and schedule.,,,,0,,,,,,
Several L-band technologies were identified as candidates to support future en route communication due to favorable propagation characteristics and because of spectrum congestion in the VHF band.,,,,1,,,,,,
Technology selection remains one of the primary goals in L-band system development.,,,,0,,,,,,
None of the considered technologies were fully recommended primarily due to concerns about the operational compatibility (spectrum interference) with existing systems in the L-band and/or because of lack of sufficient technical maturity.,,,,1,,,,,,
The assessment of the candidate technologies did lead to the identification of desirable technology features to be used as a basis for the development of a spectrally compatible L-band data link solution.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Considering these features and the most promising candidates, two options for the L-band Digital Aeronautical Communication System (L–DACS) were identified.",,,,0,,,,,,
These options need further consideration before final selection of a single data link technology.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The first option for L–DACS is a frequency division duplex (FDD) configuration utilizing OFDM modulation techniques, reservation based access control and advanced network protocols.",,,,0,,,,,,
This solution is a derivative of the B–AMC and TIA–902 (P34) technologies.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The second L– DACS option is a time division duplex (TDD) configuration utilizing a binary modulation derivative of the implemented UAT system (CPFSK family) and of existing commercial (e.g., GSM) systems and custom protocols for lower layers providing high quality-of-service management capability.",,,,0,,,,,,
This solution is a derivative of the LDL and AMACS technologies.,,,,0,,,,,,
The following table depicts the key characteristics of the two options.,,,,0,,,,,,
The L–DACS1 option represents the state of the art in the commercial developments employing modern modulation techniques and may lead to utilisation/adaptation of commercial products and standards.,,,,1,,,,,,
"The L–DACS2 option capitalises on experience from aviation specific systems and standards such as the VDL3, VDL4 and UAT.",,,,0,,,,,,
"In addition to the air/ground capability, some of the assessed technologies could also support additional features such as air/air (point to point and/or broadcast) communications and digital voice.",,,,0,,,,,,
However the support of these capabilities needs further investigation.,,,,0,,,,,,
The L band data link investigations were primarily based on simulations and analytical investigations.,,,,0,,,,,,
Therefore there is the need to validate the theoretical findings and confirm expected performances using real equipment (Ref.,,,,1,,,,,,
"In line with the AP–17, follow-on activities to further characterize the proposed L–DACS options, validate their performance, and lead to a single technology recommendation for the L-band (Ref.",,,,1,,,,,,
The SESAR Definition Phase recommended expediting the development and validation of the L band selected technology by developing initial prototypes to support feasibility assessment.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Furthermore, it recommended making final technology selection in coordination with other regions by 2010, to allow the development of the technical specifications for inclusion in ICAO SARPs and Manuals.",,,,1,,,,,,
"To complete the selection of the L–DACS, the detailed specifications for L–DACS1 and L–DACS2 were to be developed in 2009 along with interference scenarios, compatibility criteria, and a testing plan.",,,,1,,,,,,
"These activities were proposed to be followed by SESAR joint undertaking (JU) prototype development, testing, and evaluation in to assess the overall performance of L–DACS1 and L–DACS2 systems.",,,,1,,,,,,
The selection of the most appropriate system could then be considered in a global framework involving ICAO.,,,,0,,,,,,
"At this time, one or more prototypes for L–DACS systems are still being developed.",,,,0,,,,,,
"As d above, FAA schedule and activities have been adjusted accordingly.",,,,0,,,,,,
It is proposed to allow moving from airspace based to trajectory-based operations.,,,,0,,,,,,
The COCR identifies two phases of implementation of operational service capabilities.,,,,0,,,,,,
Initial steps under this phase are currently being implemented.,,,,0,,,,,,
During the second phase data communications is to become the primary means of A/G communication supporting increased automation in the aircraft and on the ground.,,,,1,,,,,,
The L-band system is proposed to be introduced during the second phase of FRS implementation.,,,,1,,,,,,
It should support A/G as well as A/A communications.,,,,0,,,,,,
A/A communications would be considered a second stage following the A/G communications implementation.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Mobile-to-mobile communications applies to aircraft in the air (second stage, shown in green).",,,,0,,,,,,
No mobile-to-mobile services are currently identified involving aircraft on the ground.,,,,0,,,,,,
An L-band communications system is proposed to support UAS.,,,,0,,,,,,
Mobile-to-mobile UAS to be implemented at the later stage (shown in green).,,,,0,,,,,,
Mobile-to-mobile (A/A) communications could be broadcast or addressed.,,,,0,,,,,,
Addressed communications implementation may require further development of various network layers.,,,,0,,,,,,
Fixed-to-fixed communication is not supported by the proposed system.,,,,0,,,,,,
"However, transition issues need to be identified early in the system development process to assure they are properly addressed by the time of system deployment.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Because the system will be implemented after many other NextGen components are already in place (e.g., DataComm and C-band aeronautical mobile airport communications system, or AeroMACS), it will have an advantage of benefiting from the work and lessons learned during prior transitions.",,,,1,,,,,,
As d in the NextGen Task Force Midterm report (Ref.,,,,0,,,,,,
The NextGen Task Force is focusing on the difficult transition issues that must be addressed to achieve the goals of improving the performance of the NAS while transitioning to NextGen.,,,,1,,,,,,
"This will require us to address policies, procedures, operational approval processes, certification, regulatory guidance, training, criteria and standards—along with technology.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Most importantly, we must put ourselves in a position to clearly demonstrate improvements in capacity, efficiency and access in the next 3 to 5 years so the operator community will have the confidence and the commitment to make the business case for the technology investments needed for beyond 2015.",,,,0,,,,,,
"We have a plan; now it is time to begin the really difficult work of execution, which is much more difficult than planning because it requires commitment to action.",,,,1,,,,,,
A final selection of services chosen as applications for the new system will greatly influence transition time and process.,,,,1,,,,,,
"When implemented, the system will provide a long-term capacity solution and will allow the introduction of new communications services.",,,,1,,,,,,
A gradual transition to the new band and services will lead to mixed equipage aircraft cooperating for extensive periods of time.,,,,1,,,,,,
A special consideration is given to the transition of UAS operations.,,,,0,,,,,,
One aspect of the way ahead is to consider that not all UAS CC links need to operate in the same frequency bands or use the same technologies.,,,,0,,,,,,
All that is required is sufficient connectivity to allow individual UAs to operate in their desired airspace.,,,,0,,,,,,
Thus an evolutionary process is possible without mandating migration of existing UAS operations to the new bands and transmission systems as they become available.,,,,1,,,,,,
"If an evolutionary process is chosen, some communications technologies could be made available for UAS operations quickly while others are being developed.",,,,1,,,,,,
"It is important to note that with an evolutionary process, the short-term solutions will possibly have limited capacity so expansion of UAS operations beyond a limited capacity will require the introduction of the next solution.",,,,0,,,,,,
A/A communications is shown as being provided on L-band only.,,,,1,,,,,,
UAS- related services are assumed and shown as provided on L-band.,,,,0,,,,,,
L-band and C-band systems are “connected” through the ground network only.,,,,1,,,,,,
L-band systems will not access C-band sensors or otherwise communicate with the C-band fixed assets directly.,,,,0,,,,,,
Transition issues will include but not be limited to the controllers adjusting communications procedures from voice to a mixed voice/data to potentially data-only communications for some information transfers.,,,,0,,,,,,
"With respect to voice vs. data communications, it should be d, that voice communications are likely to remain as a backup in case of data communications failures and “voice-based procedures will remain as an alternative form of communications depending on the dynamics of the situation” (Ref.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Additionally, as d earlier, the second stage of L-band implementation may include digital voice-based services.",,,,0,,,,,,
Key system engineering processes are completed to serve as inputs to synthesis.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Then, synthesis products are used to drive design specifications and lead to systems that satisfy the requirements.",,,,0,,,,,,
Each of the elements in the chart are not a one-step task but rather an iterative process undergoing multiple iterations before producing an output that could be used by a proceeding process.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Additionally, as shown in Figure 35, processes are interrelated and loop back to verify and fine-tune the results.",,,,0,,,,,,
Manual (SEM) requirements and architecture definition process (Ref.,,,,0,,,,,,
The FCI aeronautical data services definition task produced a list of services identified as potential applications for an L-band system.,,,,0,,,,,,
An L-band system can be viewed as part of the FRS providing a subset of services described in the COCR.,,,,0,,,,,,
"As such, many of the requirements identified in the COCR would apply to the proposed L–DACS.",,,,0,,,,,,
Preliminary safety and security risk analyses (typically performed as part of the specialty engineering process shown in the Figure 35) define system design specifications required to provide a necessary level of safety and system security.,,,,0,,,,,,
Initial prototype design specifications for L–DACS1 and L–DACS2 were developed in Europe and are part of the iterative system development process.,,,,0,,,,,,
Interference scenarios have been defined to support future testing.,,,,0,,,,,,
Matching these specifications to system requirements and continuing the interference testing process will be part of requirements management and final technology selection.,,,,0,,,,,,
The final technology selection will be based on several technology assessment studies conducted to date.,,,,0,,,,,,
AM(R)S spectrum21 is currently at or near saturation in high-traffic areas.,,,,0,,,,,,
As stated in the Spectrum Issues and the WRC–07 FAA Preparation presentation at the 2007 ICNS Conference (Ref.,,,,0,,,,,,
That is the band that L–DACS is designed by EUROCONTROL in which to operate.,,,,0,,,,,,
The attributes of L-band selected to provide en route communications include (Ref.,,,,0,,,,,,
Allocations designated as “(route)” or “(R)” for ATC and AOC.,,,,0,,,,,,
WRC Conference Preparatory Committee Methods (CPMs): 960- to 1024- or 960- to 1164-MHz with no change to the current allocation always being a (usually unstated) CPM.,,,,0,,,,,,
The current U.S. WRC proposal supports 960- to 1024-MHz with regulatory protections for existing uses.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Several civil and military systems operate, or will operate, in parts of the 960- to 1215-MHz band, as shown in Figure 36.",,,,0,,,,,,
Detailed compatibility analyses are required between the proposed L-band system and the incumbents.,,,,1,,,,,,
Option 1: B–AMC utilizing spectrum between successive DME channels deploying the proposed system as an inlay in the L-band (960 to 1164 MHz).,,,,0,,,,,,
B–AMC frequency planning is required to implement the system utilizing channels between successive DME channels.,,,,1,,,,,,
Option 2: assigning frequencies to B–AMC channels in areas where they are not used locally by DME.,,,,0,,,,,,
"A combination of selecting B–AMC channels with a certain frequency offset from nearby DME systems, and ensuring that a minimum separation distance is maintained to allow avoiding causing interference to DME, SSR, and UAT.",,,,1,,,,,,
The report s that insufficient information is available to determine whether it is technically feasible to implement this option.,,,,0,,,,,,
"When selecting appropriate centre frequencies for the B–AMC system, all interferers with the power level below –100 dBm can be neglected.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Moreover, the interference situation in each channel can be simplified to one representative interferer with representative power and duty cycle, hence facilitating the ranking of different candidate centre frequencies with respect to interference condition.",,,,1,,,,,,
The conducted studies highlighted the need for interference testing.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Though interference depends on many factors, the document defines general procedures that should apply to any L-band frequency range.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The document describes creating a DME interference simulator, discusses the methodology for generating interference scenarios taking into account DME ground stations, and investigates interference originating from aircraft interrogating these stations.",,,,0,,,,,,
Examples of interference scenarios for B–AMC reverse and/or forward links are given as appropriate.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Interference from other L-band systems is addressed by modeling JTIDS, UAT, and SSR pulses.",,,,0,,,,,,
DME systems and a B–AMC system providing a future A/G communication service in the L-band while assessing relevant system design issues.,,,,0,,,,,,
The DME and B–AMC coexistence study report draws the following conclusions and makes recommendations to EUROCONTROL (Ref.,,,,0,,,,,,
"As it is not clear whether benefits of OFDM on the reverse link overweigh the need for a highly linear airborne power amplifier, it is recommended to examine methods to reduce peak-to-mean ratio of OFDM in the reverse link (e.g., by using a single carrier FDMA or a similar technique).",,,,1,,,,,,
Interference link budgets indicate that coexistence of B–AMC and DME systems is possible with a guard band of one DME channel between them.,,,,0,,,,,,
"It is recommended to investigate whether key FCS system parameters could be selected in line with a commercial OFDM standard (e.g., WiMAX) to an extent that would facilitate partial reuse of COTS solutions.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Without a guard band, and disregarding the effects of terrain, existing DME stations in Europe could cause up to –75 dBm peak and –87 dBm mean interference into a B–AMC receiver at a 9000-m altitude, assuming optimal frequency planning.",,,,0,,,,,,
"It is recommended to assess whether it is possible to have the required guard band between DME and B–AMC through frequency coordination, taking into account the DME deployment in Europe and the effects of terrain.",,,,0,,,,,,
The draft B–AMC frequency plan addresses interference and compatibility issues (Ref.,,,,0,,,,,,
The draft frequency planning approach described in this report is restricted to the scenarios involving only B–AMC and DME systems.,,,,0,,,,,,
"As the En-Route coverage is the most demanding case with respect to the usage of spectral resources, this case has been investigated in detail—TMA and airport planning have been delegated to the future work.",,,,1,,,,,,
The document specifies basic frequency planning rules according to B–AMC Deployment Option 2—inlay deployment with a 0.5-MHz frequency offset between B–AMC and existing DME channels and presents an initial draft frequency plan for the deployment of B–AMC within Europe (Ref.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Within the initial planning exercise, large 120 nm En-Route B–AMC cells have been considered, with ground B–AMC TX power of +38 dBm.",,,,1,,,,,,
"As expected, simultaneously considering the interference from the B–AMC GS [ground station] towards airborne DME receivers and the interference from DME GSs towards airborne B–AMC receivers have imposed strong restrictions upon the pool of available B–AMC frequencies.",,,,1,,,,,,
"In the consequence, for some B–AMC cells an appropriate B–AMC inlay frequency could not be found (at least not without re-arranging DME allocations).",,,,1,,,,,,
The B–AMC en route system can be operated as a cellular system with different cell sizes.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Taking into account the dense distribution of DME and TACAN stations in Europe, as an overall conclusion the obtained preliminary results are quite positive.",,,,0,,,,,,
"However, detailed evaluation of the B–AMC interference situation is required, covering all interference scenarios mentioned in subchapter 3.1.3 [of Draft B–AMC Frequency Plan report] and considering appropriate reuse distances.",,,,0,,,,,,
Investigating other interference cases that could not be considered in this report (A/A and A/G) and their impact upon frequency planning should be included as a topic for future work.,,,,0,,,,,,
All the studies described in this section were conducted for B–AMC/L–DACS1 systems.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Common assumptions, metrics, and interference criteria for both candidate technologies should be established and followed to enable an objective comparison between them.",,,,1,,,,,,
"In June 2010, the Preliminary Report on Interference Mitigation Techniques.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Specifically, it considers the aircraft L-band cosite interference scenario, while leaving evaluation of other interference scenarios as subject of the follow-on Task 1b activity.",,,,0,,,,,,
"For instance, cross polarization used with signal canceller, pulse blanking, or array of dual- polarized antennas may be good choices, which have to be more thoroughly studied in T1b.",,,,0,,,,,,
"L–DACS on the incumbent L-band systems, current European L–DACS interference mitigation are focused exclusively on the impact of the incumbent L-band system transmissions on L–DACS receiving systems.",,,,0,,,,,,
It is recommended that further evaluation on the impact of L–DACS transmissions on the incumbent L-band system receiving systems be performed when the L–DACS design has sufficiently matured.,,,,1,,,,,,
EUROCONTROL has funded studies to provide the specifications for the L–DACS.,,,,0,,,,,,

Seamless data link is available for most pilot and service provider communications.,,,,0,,,,,,
Some emergency communications are automatically sent to both pilot and the service provider to further increase safety by eliminating the time necessary for a human to relay the message.,,,,1,,,,,,
Examples of such messages are wind shear alerts (generated either by airborne or ground equipment) and airborne and surface collision resolution advisories.,,,,0,,,,,,
Changes in airspace structures and route definitions in addition to the positions and predicted time- based trajectories are updated and registered within the NASCR for easy access via SWIM.,,,,0,,,,,,
Properly equipped aircraft receive an increased number of services via data link.,,,,0,,,,,,
"These services includes certain ATC clearances, current and forecast weather, NOTAMs and hazardous weather warnings, updated charts, SUA status, and other required data that are up-linked (or data-loaded) to the aircraft to facilitate better planning.",,,,1,,,,,,
"For properly equipped aircraft, updates to navigation terrain and obstacle databases are provided over data link.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Airspace sectorization changes dynamically based on weather, demand, and user preferences.",,,,0,,,,,,
These changes are accomplished through automated coordination (SYSCO) with all affected domestic and international service providers.,,,,0,,,,,,
"By taking advantage of advanced information and communications capabilities, airspace design and underlying sector configurations are no longer constrained by the current geographic boundaries, particularly in high altitude.",,,,0,,,,,,
This increased flexibility permits changes to the configuration of air traffic facilities.,,,,1,,,,,,
This improved autonomy combined with greater ability to share information permits the workload to be distributed between service provider and user in a balance appropriate for the operations being conducted.,,,,1,,,,,,

Following is the same hierarchical decomposition presented in the outline style.,,,,0,,,,,,
Section 6 (Conclusions) of the proposed changes to Annex 16 of 5B/296-E in Reference 44.,,,,0,,,,,,
It has to be d that the video requirements is not yet decided as mandatory by the civil aviation authorities.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The assessment of these spectrum requirements have been based on assumptions described in the PDN report ITU-R M [UAS-SPEC] (cells/spots radius, frequency reuse factor, etc.).",,,,0,,,,,,
"Regarding sharing studies on WRC–11 Agenda item 1.3 in specific bands, these assumptions, and therefore the spectrum requirements, could be refined.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The detail of those requirements is shown in Figure 72, Figure 73, and Figure 74.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Both satellite systems, particularly the regional-beam one, are clearly much more bandwidth-intensive than the terrestrial system.",,,,0,,,,,,
A hybrid system consisting of terrestrial and satellite components would have an aggregate bandwidth requirement somewhere between the “pure terrestrial” and “pure satellite” extremes.,,,,0,,,,,,
"That hybrid bandwidth requirement would depend on the allocation of functions between the terrestrial and satellite components of the system, and on whether the satellite component has a spot-beam or regional-beam architecture.",,,,0,,,,,,
The assumed spot-beam system has a beam footprint of 391 km (243 m) in radius.,,,,0,,,,,,
The rationale for this relatively high rating is as follows.,,,,0,,,,,,
The band is highly attractive for future UAS control use from a regulatory standpoint.,,,,0,,,,,,
Its current worldwide spectrum allocation is internationally standardized and consistent from region to region.,,,,0,,,,,,
Opportunities for finding bandwidth for AM(R)S in the 960- to 1024-MHz band depend primarily on exploiting certain characteristics of the distance measuring equipment (DME) and tactical air navigation (TACAN) transmitters that are its principal current users.,,,,0,,,,,,
"First, in the 979- to 1024-MHz part of the band, all of those transmitters are at fixed ground locations.",,,,0,,,,,,
This would facilitate geographical frequency coordination between those DME/TACAN assignments and a future AM(R)S communications system.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Second, a transmitted DME signal occupies a bandwidth narrower than its nominal 1-MHz channel width.",,,,0,,,,,,
"If DME receivers are sufficiently selective, there may exist between adjacent DME channels a gap that could be utilized for AM(R)S (or UAS control and communications (CC)).",,,,1,,,,,,
"Even if that is not the case for all DME receivers, many geographical areas have numerous unused DME channels that might be usable in their entirety by AM(R)S or UAS CC without radiofrequency interference to or from DME.",,,,0,,,,,,
Consequently the band has been awarded a neutral rating in the “Potentially Available Bandwidth” category.,,,,1,,,,,,
"The band scores relatively well for link range, capacity, latency, and availability.",,,,0,,,,,,
Cosite compatibility on aircraft is a major concern in this band.,,,,0,,,,,,
"A 960- to 1024-MHz UA-borne communications transmitter would pose an interference risk to a collocated DME or universal access transceiver (UAT) receiver and, most notably, to any collocated air traffic control radar beacon system (ATCRBS) or Mode S receiver operating at 1030 MHz.",,,,0,,,,,,
Present-day manned aircraft typically protect their onboard L-band (960 to 1215 MHz) devices from mutual cosite interference by means of a suppression bus that blanks the receivers each time a collocated in-band transmitter emits a pulse.,,,,0,,,,,,
"If the transmitter has too high a duty cycle, this pulse-blanking method could unacceptably degrade receiver performance.",,,,1,,,,,,
"If future airborne UA control transmitters operate in the 960- to 1024-MHz band, they may have to employ some combination of power control, radiofrequency filtering, and/or low-duty-cycle operation to avoid interfering with collocated DME, UAT, and 1030-MHz receivers.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The problem is likely to be more severe when the UA control transmitter operates near the upper end of the 960- to 1024- MHz band, where radiofrequency filtering would afford the least protection to the 1030-MHz receivers.",,,,0,,,,,,
This cosite criterion is the only one for which the 960- to 1024-MHz band has received an unfavorable rating during the evaluation.,,,,0,,,,,,
"However, it should be d that the need for airborne transmissions in this band could be “finessed,” possibly at the cost of an additional airborne antenna, if a split-band UAS CC system is developed.",,,,1,,,,,,
"C-band, for example, might offer the opportunity for greater downlink bandwidth (thereby matching the projected asymmetry in uplink and downlink data rates), and the UAS community might willingly forgo microwave landing system (MLS).",,,,0,,,,,,
"Furthermore, a C-band downlink could more easily support ground-based sectorized, multi-beam, or “smart” antennas designed to achieve high gain on the downlink, thereby allowing lower airborne transmit power and an overall reduction in background noise level for other users of the spectrum.",,,,1,,,,,,
"New 960- to 1024-MHz ground radios would have to be installed, but they could cover most of the National Airspace System from the existing ground sites used by very high frequency (VHF)/ultrahigh frequency (UHF) air traffic control air-to-ground radios, so the band has been given a neutral rating under both of the “cost” criteria in the matrix.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The band’s inherent security is deemed to be no worse than average for terrestrial air-to-ground radio links, so a neutral rating has been given for that criterion as well.",,,,0,,,,,,

"This document is being provided as part of ITT’s NASA Glenn Research Center Aerospace Communication Systems Technical Support (ACSTS) contract NNC05CA85C, Task 7: “New ATM Requirements--Future Communications, C-band and L-band Communications Standard Development.” Task 7 was motivated by the five year technology assessment performed for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under the joint FAA-EUROCONTROL cooperative research Action Plan (AP-17), also known as the Future Communications Study (FCS).",,,,0,,,,,,
"It was based on direction provided by the FAA project-level agreement (PLA FY09_G1M.02-02v1) for “New ATM Requirements-- Future Communications.” Task 7 was separated into two distinct subtasks, each aligned with specific work elements and deliverable items.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Subtask 7-1 addressed C-band airport surface data communications standards development, systems engineering, test bed development, and tests/demonstrations to establish operational capability for what is now referred to as the Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System (AeroMACS).",,,,0,,,,,,
"Subtask 7-2, which is the subject of this report, focused on preliminary systems engineering and support of joint FAA/EUROCONTROL development and evaluation of a future L-band (960 to 1164 MHz) air/ground (A/G) communication system known as the L-band digital aeronautical communications system (L-DACS), which was defined during the FCS.",,,,0,,,,,,

Level of Review: This material has been technically reviewed by technical management.,,,,0,,,,,,
The Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) Architecture Requirements Document provides the basis for the development of an open architecture for NASA Software Defined Radios (SDRs) for space use.,,,,0,,,,,,
The STRS project is currently under the direction of the Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) Program.,,,,0,,,,,,
The Top-Level Customer Guidelines are provided by NASA Headquarters.,,,,0,,,,,,
The goals and objectives are derived from the Top-Level Customer Guidelines.,,,,0,,,,,,
"They provide broad, fundamental direction and purpose.",,,,0,,,,,,
Level 1 requirements are derived from the goals and objectives and are verifiable but are not intended to be verified directly.,,,,0,,,,,,
They will be decomposed into further requirements (Level 2 requirements) which will be verified.,,,,0,,,,,,
The Level 1 requirements are considered verified after all of the decomposed (Level 2) requirements are verified.,,,,0,,,,,,
Section 3 describes the Top-Level Customer guidelines.,,,,0,,,,,,
Section 5 describes the derived system requirements that identify the architecture consideration for this study.,,,,0,,,,,,
Section 6 provides the list abbreviations and acronyms related to the document.,,,,0,,,,,,
Guidelines were provided by NASA Headquarters and are stated below without modification.,,,,0,,,,,,
The goals and objectives clarify and expand on the Top-Level Customer Guidelines.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The architecture will not be usable if excessive burden (such as Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) and complexity) is needed for a single mission to realize the multi-mission benefits.",,,,1,,,,,,
It also should be usable with the computing elements capable of operating in the space environment.,,,,0,,,,,,
"This includes the capability to eliminate or mitigate long and short term radiation effects, perform in a vacuum, and operate in extreme temperatures.",,,,0,,,,,,
The radio should also survive the effects of launch including Near Strike Lightning (NSL) to the extent that full performance can be restored.,,,,0,,,,,,
The capabilities of elements that can operate in this environment lag behind the capabilities of ground environment elements.,,,,0,,,,,,
The architecture is expected to apply to the majority of missions with the realization that a few missions should be allowed waivers to develop a non-fully STRS conformant radio.,,,,0,,,,,,
Rationale: NASA HQ has given us the challenge to lower cost and risk and decrease the development time of software defined radios.,,,,0,,,,,,
Complex reliable software can become very costly in terms of dollars and development time.,,,,0,,,,,,
"With standard functions and interfaces defined by the architecture, code is more easily reused.",,,,0,,,,,,
Rationale: Managing the complexity of the design through a common architecture and reducing the amount of interdependence on other systems will enhance reliability.,,,,1,,,,,,
Common qualification processes and procedures will allow for improved testing methods as flaws in previous procedures are discovered and new methods are developed.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Rationale: Technology advances will continue to provide greater processing power and memory and require less size, weight, and power.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The architecture should also be able to accommodate the current and future evolution to advanced SDR concepts such as Ideal Software Radios (direct digital sampling at the antenna port) and Cognitive Radios, and should be extendable to interface with optical communication systems.",,,,0,,,,,,
Rationale: Future missions may have requirements for operations or capabilities that have not currently been considered.,,,,0,,,,,,
"For example, a higher level of security support may be required and the architecture should adapt to accommodate this new need.",,,,0,,,,,,
The existing communication infrastructure typically needs to be operational for many years.,,,,0,,,,,,
"As radio technology evolves, it is usually not feasible to upgrade all existing assets in order to operate over the air with new systems.",,,,1,,,,,,
Rationale: Space radio vendors are building and deploying software defined radios.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Given the limited number of radios that will be procured by NASA, aligning with current approaches to the extent possible is necessary.",,,,1,,,,,,
Leveraging their software and hardware development and products to the extent reasonable may reduce NASA’s costs and risks.,,,,1,,,,,,
Deviating from current practices would increase design cost and schedule and decrease reliability.,,,,1,,,,,,
Reusing all or part of the code for this limited number of waveforms will decrease development time and cost and increase reliability.,,,,1,,,,,,
STRS Architecture Requirements support a NASA perspective that often spans multiple missions.,,,,0,,,,,,
These requirements address how the various mission classes are expected to use the architecture.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The following sections list the Level 1 requirements, which were derived from the Goals/Objectives.",,,,0,,,,,,
"These requirements are intended to address the STRS Architecture, not a specific implementation.",,,,0,,,,,,
"An implementation may not require all aspects of the architecture; therefore, all requirements may not apply to each STRS-compliant software defined radio.",,,,1,,,,,,
The architecture specification will evolve depending on available technology and capabilities.,,,,0,,,,,,
Some requirements may not apply to near term applications.,,,,0,,,,,,
Layering promotes waveform application portability to alternate platforms that conform to the architecture.,,,,1,,,,,,
The STRS Architecture shall utilize an Open System Architecture approach.,,,,0,,,,,,
A useful architecture partitions functions and components such that a) functions are assigned to components clearly and b) physical interfaces among components correspond to logical interfaces among functions.,,,,0,,,,,,
"When functions, interfaces, components, and/or design rules are defined and published, the architecture is open.",,,,1,,,,,,
Open architectures facilitates interoperability among commercial and Government developers and minimizes the operational impact of upgrading hardware and software components.,,,,1,,,,,,
The STRS Architecture shall allow the radio to be flexible in physical form factor.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The radio will need to be configured into different physical form factors to meet mission size, weight, and power requirements.",,,,1,,,,,,
These form factors will require the ability to be sized based on the hardware required to implement the waveform functions.,,,,0,,,,,,
The architecture is specified as platform independent and scalable to address mission requirements.,,,,0,,,,,,
Rationale: This capability will allow the radio units to maintain communication and operational status during the reload process.,,,,1,,,,,,
The upgrade can then be implemented upon the next boot or startup.,,,,0,,,,,,
Reprogrammability provides the ability to correct latent software defects or implement new capabilities.,,,,0,,,,,,
The STRS Architecture shall allow the radio to control external hardware in real-time.,,,,,0,,,,,
Rationale: This capability will allow the radio to set and modify parameters to external hardware.,,,,,0,,,,,
"For instance, tuning external RF hardware within specified frequency bands to avoid external interference sources and changing the output level of the power amplifier.",,,,,0,,,,,
This potentially eliminates additional front- end hardware sets.,,,,,0,,,,,
The STRS Architecture shall allow the radio to use standard spacecraft interfaces.,,,,,0,,,,,
The radio will be employed on platforms using standard spacecraft interfaces for power.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The radio will need to exchange voice, video, and data with spacecraft systems using the common spacecraft software and hardware interfaces.",,,,,0,,,,,
Utilization of common spacecraft busses also enables the radio and other devices on the spacecraft bus to share excess resources such as processing power.,,,,,1,,,,,
The STRS Architecture shall allow the radio to operate more than one waveform.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Rationale: Missions typically require communications using more than one waveform, such as a mission that requires different waveforms during different phases or a mission that must use both GPS and TDRS.",,,,,1,,,,,
"By having a single radio be capable of running more than one waveform, this can reduce the number of radios for a mission.",,,,,1,,,,,
The STRS Architecture shall allow the radio to operate multiple waveforms simultaneously.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The radio could also be used for simultaneous GPS reception, thus eliminating the need for a separate receiver.",,,,,1,,,,,
"NASA missions typically need to use low frequency bands for telemetry, and high frequency bands for science data.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Future NASA missions will probably need significantly larger science data transfers from space, requiring even higher frequency bands to be implemented.",,,,,1,,,,,
"It is envisioned that future NASA missions will utilize optical communications, for direct to Earth and for inter-satellite links.",,,,,0,,,,,
"As a result, the STRS baseband unit should be capable of interfacing to optical communications hardware.",,,,,1,,,,,
Longer duration missions especially may need to adapt to using different frequency bands.,,,,,0,,,,,
"For the foreseeable future, the frequency band will probably be determined by the pre-launch installed RF components in order to reduce weight, power, and complexity.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Rationale: For example, this allows for the case where a mission requires that high criticality data be sent using a different channel than lower criticality data.",,,,,1,,,,,
Multiple simultaneous channels can also allow for increased throughput or redundancy.,,,,,1,,,,,
"This will increase reliability and availability by increasing understanding of the nature of a problem leading to a faster recovery, as well as supplying additional information to assist in improving future designs and procedures.",,,,,1,,,,,
This is not a BIT but a behavior based on operational activity.,,,,,0,,,,,
The radio detects a problem and then may issue BITs to attempt to determine if the signal loss is due to hardware or external factors.,,,,,0,,,,,
The radio must be able to return to full operation (restores back to last radio configuration/parameters/operational settings prior to fault condition) without need for external equipment or procedures.,,,,,0,,,,,
"A radio may recover from an internal error without the need to reboot or power cycle, however that is not a requirement of the architecture.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Integrating the communication and tracking system into a single radio reduces the overall required RF spectrum, mass, power, and volume allocations.",,,,,1,,,,,
Special considerations will be required in the design and implementation of the radio to implement the integrated system.,,,,,1,,,,,
Protocol (IP) including a network infrastructure comprised of dispersed network elements using various communications transport capabilities.,,,,,0,,,,,
CCSDS and IP are in common use in many existing systems and have been used in several NASA missions.,,,,,0,,,,,
New delay tolerant protocols are being considered and the architecture must adapt to support these and other future protocols.,,,,,0,,,,,
The STRS Architecture shall allow the radio to use secure transmission.,,,,,0,,,,,
The radio may not need to perform its communications functions at all times.,,,,,0,,,,,
"This optimization can include changes to the modulation and coding schemes (e.g., use a lower coding rate in favorable link conditions).",,,,,0,,,,,
This capability makes it possible to “fine-tune” the communication link much more accurately than an operator could perform a similar function.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Briones, Janette, C.; Johnson, Sandra, K.; VanDerAar, Lisa, B.",,,,,0,,,,,
The main objective of this document is to evaluate the goals and objectives and high level (Level 1) requirements that have bearing on the design of the architecture.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The goals and objectives will provide broad, fundamental direction and purpose.",,,,,0,,,,,
The high level requirements (Level 1) intend to guide the broader and longer term aspects aspects of the SDR Architecture and provide guidance for the development of level 2 requirements.,,,,,0,,,,,

"This report documents the work conducted under the NASA Advanced Transport Operating System task contract, Contract NAS1-18027, Task Assignment 15.",,,,,0,,,,,
"It describes the development of a system requirements definition fw the flight control system of a commercial-type research aimaft of Langley Research Center's Advanced Transport Operating System program, the Transport Systems Research Vehicle, also known as the NASA 515.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The objective of this work was to develop a definition of the 'kinsport Systems Research Vehicle flight control system requirements able to facilitate the research and development of alternate, more advanced software and possibly hardware architectures for modem transport aircraft flight control systems.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The NASA 515 is a highly modified Boeing 737-100 aircraft designed specifically to investigate advanced navigation, guidance, control, and display concepts.",,,,,0,,,,,
"In the experimental configuration, the aircraft is flown from a research flight deck (mounted in the aft cabin of the aircraft) whose entire flight control system is under software control.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Therefore, alternate software implementations can readily be investigated.",,,,,1,,,,,
"For the purposes of this report, the Transport Systems Research Vehicle flight control system is defined to be the baseline software for the NASA 515 research flight deck, including all navigation, guidance, and control functions, and primary pilot displays.",,,,,1,,,,,
"At the beginning of this study, the system was built around two digital Norden PDP-11/70 computers, termed Norden #1 and Norden #2.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Since that time, the system was modified and the Norden computers were replaced with DEC MicroVax computers.",,,,,1,,,,,
For this report the system will be described for the Norden computer configuration.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Norden #1 is the host to a Speny microprocessor display system which provides the Primary Flight, Navigation, and Engine Display formats; hence it is also referred to as the Displays host computer.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Norden #2 hosts the guidance, navigation, and control software; hence it is also referred to as the Flight Managemenmight Control host computer.",,,,,1,,,,,
The scope of the requirements definition contained herein is limited to a portion of the Flight Managemenmight Control computer functionality.,,,,,0,,,,,
Included is a discussion of the tasks required to increase the scope of the requirements defmition and recommendations for follow-on research.,,,,,1,,,,,
There is a strong requirement for a new generation of avionics systems with a more integrated hardware and software structure.,,,,,0,,,,,
Future cockpits will incorporate a wide range of enhancements.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Heavy application of artificial intelligence techniques can be expected to encompass the entim spectrum of crew station technologies: from data fusion to optimized display resource management, to real-time onboard maintenance and fault reporting, and even to the optimization of pilot physiological needs.",,,,,0,,,,,
There is a significant challenge to integrate symbolic and numeric computation k a real-time enhnment as well as to effectively allocate functions between man and avionics.,,,,,0,,,,,
"In addition, advances in the development of distributed and parallel processing systems necessitate the careful allocation of processing tasks among the system’s computing resources in order to realize the increased system performance, reliability, and flexibility that these architectures offer.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Consequently, an effective systems engineering analysis is required to first identify the system requirements.",,,,,1,,,,,
"A good requirements analysis addresses a system’s true requirements, that is, those essential features or capabilities that a system must possess in order to fulfill its purpose, regardless of how the system is implemented.",,,,,1,,,,,
Development of the best architecture for the application starts with a good essential requirements specification.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The objective of this work was to analyze the NASA Transport Systems Research Vehicle (TSRV) flight control system (FCS) and develop a system specification that would offer high visibility of the essential system requirements in order to facilitate the future development of alternate, more advanced software and hardware architectures.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Neither the original (i.e., essential) TSRV FCS requirements nor the evolution of the baseline software are well documented, thus the “essence” of the system was backed out of the existing implementation.",,,,,1,,,,,
The available documentation consists only of a somewhat cryptic software description document and a listing of the source code.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Consequently, the specification produced is more influenced by the particular design preferences than would be a “top down” analysis for the development of an all new system.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Furthermore, because the analysis was of an existing system, the scope of the requirements were limited to only those features actually implemented in the code.",,,,,1,,,,,
"However, a good systems analysis should specify the (essential) requirements in such a way that they may be easily modified and/or extended to include new features.",,,,,0,,,,,
The systems analysis approach used was based on the Object Oriented Analysis (OOA) methodology developed by Boeing.,,,,,0,,,,,
"In short, the Boeing OOA approach unifies traditional systems analysis methods of information modeling, process modeling (e.g., Yourdon-DeMarco Structured Analysis), and behavior modeling (e.g., Ward-Mellor Real-Time Extensions) into a single more powerful method which synergistically combines the strengths of all three methods.",,,,,0,,,,,
A Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool is extremely useful for the OOA methodology.,,,,,0,,,,,
The Cadre Technologies Inc. teamwork tool was used teamwork to the OOA methodology.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Furthermore, for this report, the teamwork data representing the TSRV FCS requirements analysis were reformatted into a single, unified, object-oriented specification.",,,,,1,,,,,
"This section contains symbols and abbreviations used throughout this report, including those used in the requirements specification of Section 6.",,,,,0,,,,,
"These are defmed in the object class descriptions found in 6.1 (see also 6.4, lndex of Identifiers).",,,,,0,,,,,
"The system of interest is the flight control system (FCS) for the research flight deck of NASA’s Transport System Research Vehicle (TSRV), a highly modified Boeing 737-100 commercial jet airplane, also referred to as the “NASA 5 15”.",,,,,0,,,,,
Hardware and software descriptions are included below only to provide a general overview of the system.,,,,,1,,,,,
Other references should be consulted for a more detailed understanding.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The TSRV is used as part of NASA’s Advanced Transport Operating System (ATOPS) program established to investigate advanced navigation, guidance, control, and display concepts.",,,,,0,,,,,
In the full-up test configuration it is flown from a second flight deck mounted in the cabin of the aircraft and referred to in this report as the Aft Flight Deck (AFD).,,,,,0,,,,,
The AFD contains the basic controls required to fly the airplane and uses the advanced controls and displays in a completely realistic environment.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The AFD pilots have essentially complete control of the airplane, although the AFD control authorities are limited and the forward flight deck (FFD) crew can take over control at any time.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The AFD features programmable electronic Primary Right Displays, Navigation Displays, and Engine Displays, a Navigation Control and Display Unit (NCDU), a glare-shield mounted Advanced Guidance and Control System (AGCS) Mode Select Panel (MSP), and Panel Mounted Controllers (PMCs) that take the place of conventional column and wheel controls.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Also, a Data Acquisition System @AS) provides real-time data recording and data display for inflight and postflight evaluation.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The system is built around two Norden digital flight computers (militarized versions of the general purpose PDP-l1/70 computer), designated Norden #1 and Norden #2.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Both computers are interfaced to the AFD and an extensive m y of sensors by a Digital Autonomous Terminal Access Communication (DATAC) system, a high-speed Norden #2, the Flight Management/Flight Controls (FIM/FC) host computer, receives sensor information and switch/button settings from the Sensor Interface Unit (SIU) across the DATAC bus.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Norden #1, the Displays host computer, interprets input information from Norden #2 as well as from the sensors to create data blocks that are sent to a microprocessor-based Sperry Color Display System which provides the primary Right, Navigation, and Engine Display formats.",,,,,1,,,,,
The Sperry system communicates with the displays host through a Direct Memory Access @MA) channel.,,,,,0,,,,,
The information from the host is by Intel 80186 microprocessors which generate data usable by S units @Us) for the creation and positioning of display symbology.,,,,,0,,,,,
There are twelve individual pieces of hardware involved in the standard Sperry display configuration.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Included are eight color display units (ded PED, NAV, or ENG in Figure 4.1), three display electronic units (DEUs), and one bus interface unit (SIU).",,,,,0,,,,,
Each DEU has four microprocessors containing programs which perform VO functions and create data in formats acceptable to the DUs.,,,,,0,,,,,
Note that one of the microprocessors contained in DEU #2 is a weather (WX) radar processor which feeds weather radar to each DEU.,,,,,0,,,,,
"For the purposes of this report, the TSRV FCS is defined by the “baseline” software for the TSRV research flight deck including all navigation, guidance, and control functions, and primary pilot displays.",,,,,1,,,,,
"It is comprised of the software contained in the Displays host computer (Norden #l), the FM/FC host computer (Norden #2), and the Sperry Color Display System.",,,,,0,,,,,
The baseline software available for analysis on this project was a 1989 source code listing provided by NASA on a magnetic tape.,,,,,0,,,,,
"This source code is best described by Reference [7], a software description document, also provided by NASA.",,,,,0,,,,,
The software described in Reference [7] is delivery 4.1 (D4.1) of the baseline FM/FC system which was released in July 1987.,,,,,0,,,,,
It should be d that these resources represent various portions of the software current on different dates.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Consequently, some inconsistencies were found during the analysis.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In these instances, the most logical and/or expedient resolution of the conflict was made; no attempt was made to document these conflicts or their resolution.",,,,,0,,,,,
"This report addresses only part of the development of a complex, integrated system: the analysis and specification of its requirements.",,,,,0,,,,,
The role of “systems analysis” in the life-cycle of a system may be best understood in the proper context.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Initially, a problem generally exists as ideas about what the issues are as well as even preconceived notions of the solution; or at best, as a partial list of requirements.",,,,,0,,,,,
"It is necessary to move from this nebulous condition to a more precise set of requirements, or better yet, a well-defined model of the requirements.",,,,,1,,,,,
"This model should be a complete, consistent, and coherent specification of the essentiaf requirements of the system.",,,,,0,,,,,
AnaZysis is the process which identifies the “essence” of a system.,,,,,0,,,,,
The concept of essence helps distinguish between the true requirements of a system and those things which are really implementation oriented and/or technology dependent.,,,,,0,,,,,
"In the analysis stage, the specification of the system should not be influenced by past design solutions -- “We’ve always done it that way” -- or by current technology constraints such as processor speeds or memory limitations.",,,,,1,,,,,
"It is important to clearly define what the system needs to do, not how it shall do it.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Following the analysis phase is the design phase, where real-world constraints as well as design preferences are imposed upon the system’s essential requirements specification.",,,,,0,,,,,
The result is a technology dependent model of a solution to the problem.,,,,,1,,,,,
"It represents one answer to the question, “How can the In the final phase of development, the design requirements are implemented in the form of hardware, software, etc.",,,,,0,,,,,
"In the case of the TSRV FCS, the systems analysis process started from a specification of the system “as built”.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Therefore, in a “reverse engineering” sense, the requirements were backed out of the existing implementation.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Nevertheless, the goal was the same: to produce a specification of the essential system requirements.",,,,,0,,,,,
The analysis of the TSRV FCS was carried out using a Boeing-developed Object Oriented Analysis (OOA) methodology.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The Boeing OOA method unifies traditional systems analysis methods of information modeling, process modeling (e.g., Yourdon-DeMarco Structured Analysis), and behavior modeling (e.g., Ward-Mellor Real-Time Extensions) into a single mure powerful method which synergistically combines the strengths of all three methods.",,,,,0,,,,,
"See References [8], [lo], [ll], and [12] for background information.",,,,,0,,,,,
OOA is an alternative to “structured analysis” as a requirements specification language.,,,,,0,,,,,
"It unifies elements of information, behavior, and processing on an atomic level (object level), whereas structured analysis provides three hierarchical system level views which are not necessarily consistent and require parallel maintenance.",,,,,1,,,,,
OOA provides a method to rigorously define the requirements of any complex system in such a way that the analyst can readily identify any missing or contradictory requirements.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The result is a complete, consistent, and simplified description of a system’s essential requirements.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Furthermore, OOA provides a solid foundation for partitioning systems into “objects” and results in a system definition which allows a smooth transition into design.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Object oriented specifications map very easily into object-oriented design and object-oriented programming (using languages such as Ada, Objective Cy and Smalltalk), but also may be readily translated into other design schemes such as a standard hierarchical structured design.",,,,,0,,,,,
OOA’s partitioning methodology and design flexibility are a few of the features which make it particularly suited to the goal of defining alternate architectures for an existing complex system.,,,,,0,,,,,
"OOA partitions a system into objects, or object classes.",,,,,0,,,,,
The goals of OOA are to assist in the “discovery” of the object classes in a system and the relationships between those object classes, and 2) to provide a mechanism to document those object classes so that they can be verified and later communicated to designers and programmers.,,,,,0,,,,
The “products” of OOA and the relationships between them are depicted in Figure 5.2.,,,,,0,,,,,
The products are the deliverable results of applying OOA to a specific system.,,,,,1,,,,,
"In other words, they are the graphic and textual models that are produced by the process of analysis.",,,,,0,,,,,
The products of OOA describe the system at two conceptual levels of detail: clars level models and system level models.,,,,,0,,,,,
Class level models provide the detailed internal views of single object classes.,,,,,0,,,,,
"System level models, on the other hand, describe the way object classes fit together to make the system as a whole.",,,,,0,,,,,
The system level models are not concerned with the internal details of the object classes.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Likewise, the internal “schematic” of each object class must not concern itself with any other object class directly (i.e., knowledge of the internal workings of another object class is not allowed).",,,,,0,,,,,
These rules support the principle of information hiding.,,,,,0,,,,,
An object class can be thought of as a template that represents the generic form of all objects which belong to that class.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Object classes can be described by the data they carry, the processes they perform, and the behavior they exhibit.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Therefore, each object class template is comprised of three class level models: a Data Model; 2) a Process Model; and 3) a Behavior Model.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In order for an object to be a member of a given class, it must conform to the class’ template: that is, it must be &scribed by the prescribed data, it must do the prescribed work (processing), and it must exhibit the prescribed behavior.",,,,,1,,,,,
The data aspect of an object class is described textually by a set of Attributes.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Each attribute represents a single meaningful fact that is pertinent to, and necessary for, all instances of that class.",,,,,0,,,,,
The set of attributes for an object class defines the information that is relevant for that class.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The Process Model captures the functionality of an object class,.",,,,,0,,,,,
The model defines the set of P rocesses that operate upon or manipulate objects within that class.,,,,,0,,,,,
A Process Model is described both graphically and textually.,,,,,0,,,,,
The graphical portion is in the form of the familiar dataflow diagram notation.,,,,,0,,,,,
A rigorous specification of the work performed by the processes is also necessary.,,,,,0,,,,,
The Structured Analysis “minispec” is a convenient mechanism for describing the details of a process.,,,,,0,,,,,
The behavior aspect of an object class is described by a finite state automaton.,,,,,0,,,,,
This can be thought of as a collection of States and Transitions which respond to certain Events.,,,,,0,,,,,
"A state is a phase, stage, mode, or condition of being.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The states for an object class are distinguished by ongoing processing, recognized events, and the responses to those events.",,,,,0,,,,,
"An event is a circumstance, occurrence, or happening which may cause a change in the state of an object.",,,,,1,,,,,
There are two system level models that show how the population of object classes in the system are interconnected.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The Object Class Relationship Model (OCRM) and the Object Class Communication Model (OCCM) depict how the object classes interrelate and interact, respectively.",,,,,0,,,,,
This model describes the gxistence relationships among object classes.,,,,,0,,,,,
"On the other hand, the OCCM depicts the glvnamic communication which takes human pilot (object) may -- at some time -- send the following commands (in place between objects during the life of the system.",,,,,0,,,,,
"A rough example is: ""the the form of data &fined in the appropriate Data Model) to the autopilot (object): number of communications that take place in a system render a single communication diagram of the whole system unreadable, multiple communication diagrams can be developed each focusing on a related subset of the communications in the system.",,,,,0,,,,,
"It should be d that a complete understanding of the internals (data, behavior, processing) of every object class is generally not required, and sometimes may not be possible.",,,,,0,,,,,
"This gives rise to a special type of object class, an external object class.",,,,,0,,,,,
All that need be known about them is that they are the sources and/or destinations of named events and data for the system.,,,,,0,,,,,
The external object classes are identified in the analysis because they are significant in the overall understanding of the system.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Later, these classes may be represented in the design phase by VO interface routines.",,,,,0,,,,,
"In the analysis phase, every object class must either be described by data, process, and behavior models, or be designated as an external object class.",,,,,1,,,,,
"A strategy serves the purpose of guiding the analyst toward the goal of completing the analysis, and different strategies may be appropriate in different situations.",,,,,0,,,,,
The analysis strategy used here was necessarily oriented toward the OOA methodology.,,,,,0,,,,,
The strategy was to develop the OOA models (see 5.3) of the system requirements using an information centered approach.,,,,,0,,,,,
"With this strategy, the analyst focuses frrst on the information aspect of a system in order to discover as many of the object classes as possible.",,,,,1,,,,,
The result of this activity is a fmt approximation of the OCRM along with Data Models for each of the object classes found so far.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Note that at this stage, those objects with little or no data (i.e., those which are more process and/or behavior intensive) have not necessariiy been discovered: the list and definitions of the object classes are likely to be incomplete at this juncture.",,,,,0,,,,,
"As subsequent phases of analysis (e.g., behavior and process modeling) are pedomed, new object classes may be discovered, or a few existing ones may be combined or split up.",,,,,0,,,,,
"This is to be expected given a ""bottom up"" strategy of discovering object classes; the existence and completeness of an object class cannot truly and finally be validated until its Data, Process and Behavior Models are all &fined.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Next, the analyst models the behavior aspect of the system by developing a Behavior Model for each object class.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Additional behavior requirements not expressed by the Behavior Models for the known object classes may hint at the existence of hidden (i.e., as yet undiscovered) object classes that need to be exposed or at the need to re-partition some of the existing object classes.",,,,,0,,,,,
The next step involves modeling the processing aspect of the system by developing a Process Model for each object class.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The approach is to examine every state and every transition defined in the Behavior A4 1 for every object class and ask the question, “Is anything svpposed to happen in this state or on this transition?’ Processes are then created to represent the work required and those processes are coupled with the appropriate states or transitions.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Again, additional processing requirements may expose new object classes.",,,,,0,,,,,
"In this strategy, the development of the communication model is a relatively mechanical process as no new information should be discovered.",,,,,0,,,,,
The task should be a simple matter of connecting the outputs of each object class to the appropriate inputs of the others.,,,,,0,,,,,
The description of this strategy implies a relatively step-by-step approach.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Nevertheless, it was a useful strategy, particularly for an analysis of an existing functional implementation where the existence and partitioning of objects was not obvious.",,,,,0,,,,,
"A CASE tool can be thought of as a database management application which includes graphics objects and freeform text entities in its database schema, includes editors for the manipulation of these, and provides appropriate navigation throughout the database.",,,,,0,,,,,
The Cadre Technologies Inc. teamwork family of tools (Reference [13]) was used as it was readily available at Boeing.,,,,,0,,,,,
The teamwork CASE tool family automates standard structured methodologies using interactive computer graphics and multi-user workstation power.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Using teamwork the analyst can examine the system being developed from multiple viewpoints -- all within one integrated environment that monitors the entire project’s progress, rigorously checks for errors and produces automatic documentation.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Teamwork’s checking facilities provide automatic verification of the models by checking for completeness of the models, checking for consistency between models, and helping to find syntax errors.",,,,,0,,,,,
Teamwork analysis tools help create descriptions and smctured analysis of complex specifications.,,,,,0,,,,,
They allow description in both functional and object- oriented analysis.,,,,,1,,,,,
"However, teamwork does not directly support an object oriented analysis approach.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Consequently, various conventions were developed to adapt teamwork to the OOA methodology.",,,,,1,,,,,
Creative utilization of teamwork has allowed essential information not directly supported by teamwork to be recorded in the requirements specification (Section 6).,,,,,0,,,,,
Details regarding these conventions are described in 5.6.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Also, for the purposes of this report, a Boeing-developed teamwork database report writer was used to format the TSRV FCS requirements analysis into a single, unified, object-oriented specification (Section 6).",,,,,0,,,,,
"When reviewing the requirements specification given in Section 6, it may be helpful to know beforehand some details regarding the conventions that have been followed.",,,,,1,,,,,
This sub-section documents the conventions present in the printed reports and diagrams that comprise the requirements specification.,,,,,0,,,,,
"It does not attempt to explain all of the rationale behind various conventions, but rather is intended to be a concise resource for the reader of the specification.",,,,,0,,,,,
"For this reason, notation that has been published and is generally known is not explained.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Furthermore, familiarity with the concepts of OOA is assumed (see , while knowledge of teamwork (see 5.5) is not.",,,,,0,,,,,
Teamwork did not directly support the Boeing OOA methodology.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Although special application of the standard notation and conventions were defined by the tool developer to support Project Technology’s Real-Time Object Oriented Analysis (see Reference [12]), these conventions were lacking in various respects.",,,,,0,,,,,
"For example, one naming convention that required object class names to contain parentheses and spaces made it difficult to navigate within the software and eliminated any chance of producing an error report.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Consequently, various conventions were developed to adapt teamwork to the Boeing OOA methodology.",,,,,1,,,,,
Reference [ 141 contains additional background on some of the basic problems as well as solutions associated with using off-the- shelf CASE tools for Object Oriented Analysis.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Any convention typically satisfies a number of demands simultaneously, though perhaps not all of them ideally.",,,,,0,,,,,
"A compromise is often required among content, readability, ease of use, and teamwork’s “happiness” with the idea.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The conventions outlined below maximize content but avoid sabotaging the automation offered by teamwork (such as error reports, listings, on-line navigation among elements in the specification).",,,,,0,,,,,
"At the same time, this supplementary-to-teamwork information is captured in a rigorous fashion, amenable to mechanical (i.e,, automated) syntax checking and cross- referencing.",,,,,0,,,,,
Some of the conventions are conventions required by teamwork.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Others are Boeing-developed, and have enabled the recording of essential information in an OOA specification that is not directly supported -- and therefore not expected -- by teamwork.",,,,,1,,,,,
The following paragraphs are &signed to allow the reader of the specification to extract important information at a glance.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Words are generally capitalized and separated by an underscore (‘-’); exceptions are allowed for small words such as “is”, “or”, etc.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Names always begin with a letter and contain only letters, numbers, underscores and dashes.",,,,,0,,,,,
The dash (‘-’) is used only when explicitly required by these conventions, it is not used otherwise.,,,,,1,,,,
"A given name is generally made up of two or more parts, separated by the reserved dash character.",,,,,0,,,,,
"One of these parts will be the basic mme of the thing in question; that is, the ‘common’ word or phrase which is used in the analysis to uniquely identify the thing.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The other parts, preceding and/or following this basic name, will embody useful or even necessary information.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Teamwork, however, considers the name of the thing to be the full string of characters, and is thus unaffected by the augmentation.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The full string of characters is sometimes r e f e d to as the official name, or as simply the name of the object.",,,,,0,,,,,
Object names always begin with capital letters followed by a double dash.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Attribute, derived attribute names and event names always begin with lower case letters, followed by “- 1-”, “-2-”, and “-3-”, respectively.",,,,,0,,,,,
Relationship names always begin with the form ‘RnnA’ or ‘RnnB’ followed by a single dash.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Every object class has a name, a description, and the following models: a Data Model andlor a Behavior Model and/or a Process Model.",,,,,0,,,,,
An object class’ Several conventions were followed regarding the representation of object class templates in the specification.,,,,,0,,,,,
"These include some which relate to the building of a name for a class, the format of its description, primary identifier, and aliases, and its appearance on system level diagrams.",,,,,0,,,,,
These whole-object conventions are explained in detail in 5.6.2.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Conventions for the various parts of an object class tempIate (i.e., those associated with the parts of the class level models) are documented in 5.6.3, 5.6.4, and 5.6.5.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Refer also to 5.6.1, General Conventions for All Names.",,,,,0,,,,,
The official object name consists of two parts: the object id and the basic name, these are separated by a pair of dashes.,,,,,0,,,,
"The object id is always present, always unique, generally mnemonic, and always entered in all capital letters.",,,,,0,,,,,
"It is typically made from the first letters of the object’s name (“FP” for “Flight Plan”, “WFP” for “Waypoint on a Flight Plan”), though not always (“WPT” for “Waypoint”).",,,,,0,,,,,
"This id is always two or more characters, and always begins with a letter.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The baric name is always in the singular, naming a typical instance of the object class.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The description is always present, indented from the left margin.",,,,,0,,,,,
The precise kind of object class being defined is given in italics within parentheses immediately prior to the body of the description.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The following entries for object class kind may appear: regular object class; anonymous object class; external object class; external, anonymous object class; anonymous object class, no attributes; external, anonymous object class, no attributes.",,,,,0,,,,,
Any non-anonymous object class must have one or more identifiers.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The chosen primary identifier is introduced with the key phrase ""primary identifier"".",,,,,0,,,,,
"When several attributes form the primary id, each attribute is separated by a plus sign (""+""), and should appear on a line of its own; the last attribute may be followed by a period (""."").",,,,,1,,,,,
"Comment blocks, if present, are delineated with a begin and end asterisk (""*',).",,,,,1,,,,,
Non-primary identifiers are indicated via attribute naming conventions.,,,,,0,,,,,
"If so, these are indicated using the format shown above.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Please note that the attribute list which appears inside the rectangle of a given object class on the Object Class Relationship Diagram (OCRD) is enclosed in a comment block -- it has been entered manually, and teamwork has not checked for agreement between this list and the list which is part of the object’s definition.",,,,,1,,,,,
"It may help to know this in case a subsequent change is required, or an inconsistency should arise.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Please note that just the object id appears within the object class rectangles on Object Class Communication Diagrams (OCCDs), to conserve diagram space.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Also note that, by convention, a pair of asterisks following such an object id indicates that the context of the object class is not fully defined on that particular diagram; that is, there may be some data and/or events not shown on the diagram which this object class consumes or provides.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Several conventions were followed regarding the representation of attributes, derived attributes, events and processes in the analysis.",,,,,0,,,,,
"These include some which relate to the building of a name for one, the fonnat of its definition, and its appearance on diagrams.",,,,,0,,,,,
The notion of a cornon domain also aided in concise representation.,,,,,0,,,,,
An attribute’s ofsicial name contains within it various flags and indicators (see Conventions for ADCEP Names).,,,,,0,,,,,
Its definition captures two things: the domain of values which the attribute can take on, and the precise meaning of those values for this attribute.,,,,,0,,,,
The former is captured via a domain specification, the latter via an English description (see Conventional Format for ADCEP Definitions).,,,,,0,,,,
"Common domains are created whenever two or more attributes share a common domain of values, due to an essential similarity (not a coincidence).",,,,,1,,,,,
"This is done to follow the guideline, “Document each fact in just one place.” In these cases, the group of similar attributes simply reference the common domain definition by its name, rather than repeat the shared domain specification.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Like attributes, every common domain has a nume and a definition.",,,,,0,,,,,
Attributes which reference other definitions are said to have nonprimitive definitions.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Attributes come by nonprimitive definitions in three ways: by referencing common domains as described above, by being referential attributes, or by being compound attributes.",,,,,0,,,,,
An attribute which directly is said to have a primitive definirion.,,,,,0,,,,,
"A common domain usually has a primitive Wnition (i.e., usually contains its .",,,,,0,,,,,
"However, some common domains are compound domains, and these have nonprimitive definitions.",,,,,0,,,,,
Compound domains reference other common domains (never attributes).,,,,,0,,,,,
"Derived attributes are identical to (regular) attributes except in an information modeling (data normalization) sense: they represent not stored data, but data derived from a process.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The process which derives a particular derived attribute may be explicitly defined for clarity or use in the Behavior Model, but is often left as an implied, always-available process.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Like attributes and common domains, every derived attribute has a name and a definition which consists of a description and a domain specification (which may be primitive, nonprimitive, or compound).",,,,,0,,,,,
The description of an event captures the precise meaning of the event when it occurs.,,,,,1,,,,,
Every process has a name and a description (also known as a minispec).,,,,,0,,,,,
"The description of a process captures what the process must accomplish, not how it will be accomplished: it is not algorithmic.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Attributes, derived attributes, common domains, events and processes are quite similar in regards to the conventions followed for them.",,,,,0,,,,,
"An ADCEP is “an attribute / derived attribute / common domain / event / process”, i.e., either an attribute or a derived attribute or a common domain or an event or a process.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The official ADCEP name consists of at least two parts: first (except for process names), the object id of the object class which is the source of the ADCEP in question (or, in the case of a common domain, the characters “domn” stand in the place of the object id); next, the basic name of the ADCEP; next, zero or more referential attribute tags; finally, zero or more identifier tags.",,,,,0,,,,,
It is a consequence of the above naming convention that a global dictionary immediately after listing the object class.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Also, all common domains will be defined in a contiguous block.",,,,,0,,,,,
"This considerably improves the readability and usefulness of such a printout, and aids the analysis process.",,,,,1,,,,,
The object id (and “domn”) is always entered in all lower case letters.,,,,,0,,,,,
This simply improves readability by markedly distinguishing an ADCEP name from an object class name (entered in all capital letters).,,,,,1,,,,,
The basic name of the ADGEP signifies the meaning of the values in the domain of the ADCEP.,,,,,0,,,,,
The meaning may be moE precisely defined within the ADCEP’s definition.,,,,,0,,,,,
Referential attributes will include one or more referential attribute ~ g s .,,,,,0,,,,,
"These tags will be of the form ‘RnnA’ or ‘RnnB’, and serve to (a) flag an attribute as referential; and (b) indicate which relationship(s) are referenced, that is, from which related object class the attribute was borrowed.",,,,,0,,,,,
"For example, the reader immediately knows that the attribute “wfp-l-Flight-- Plan-Name-RO1 A” is a referential attribute, because it has the ‘R’ tag “ROl A”.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Specifically, the reader sees that relationship “RO1” is referenced, and that the object class connected to line “ROl A” is the object class from which the attribute comes.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Therefore, the reader knows that the attribute “wfp-1-Flight-Plan-Name-ROlA” is in an essential sense equivalent to one of the attributes from the object class “FP--Flight-Plan”.",,,,,1,,,,,
Exactly which attribute has been borrowed from the object class cannot be discerned from the attribute name itself, it is documented via the attribute’s definition (see Conventional Format for ADCEP Definitions).,,,,,0,,,,
"These tags name the identifier (primary, secondary, tedary, ...) of which an attribute is a part.",,,,,0,,,,,
"For example, the attribute “wpt-1-Latitude-idO2” forms part of a secondary identifier for the “WPT--Waypoint” object class.",,,,,0,,,,,
"An ADCEP definition captures two things: the domain of values which the the meaning is often clear from the name of the ADCEP, a more precise description is usually helpful.",,,,,0,,,,,
The domain of values is described in essenzid (technology indepen&nt) terms, how these values might be stored in memory or on disk is of no concern in analysis.,,,,,0,,,,
An ADCEP definition consists of a well-structured body of text.,,,,,0,,,,,
The six examples below illustrate some of the various kinds of definitions.,,,,,0,,,,,
They are followed by the details of the exact structure.,,,,,0,,,,,
Every definition begins with the ADCEP name in bold print on a line by itself.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The precise kind of ADCEP being defined is given in italics within parentheses on the next line, indented 0.125 inches.",,,,,0,,,,,
"An ADCEP definition usually has a description, indented 0.5 inches from the ADCEP name, and consisting of free-form English text.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Except for events and processes, the description captures the precise meaning of the information recorded by the ADCEP.",,,,,0,,,,,
"This description is commonly a brief, incomplete sentence like those of a normal dictionary entry, which assumes the reader foxmat is to begin the description with “This...”; the word mfers to the ADCEP might be implemented.",,,,,0,,,,,
The description for an ADCEP may be omitted where obvious from the name.,,,,,1,,,,,
The ADCEP’s domain specification (if any) is enclosed in a rectangle indented from both margins about 1 inch.,,,,,1,,,,,
There are two kinds of domain specifications: primitive and nonprimitive.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The ADCEP itself is said to have either a primitive or nonprimitive definition, accordingly.",,,,,0,,,,,
A nonprimitive definition references other ADCEPs in its domain spec@cation.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Generally, just a single ADCEP is referenced; occasionally, two or more may be referenced.",,,,,0,,,,,
Teamwork checks referenced ADCEPs when validating a nonprimitive definition.,,,,,1,,,,,
"When two or more ADCEPs are referenced, this indicates that the ADCEP is actually composed of two or more meaningful parts, each with its own domain.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Reference to this ADCEP is, strictly speaking, a shorthand for reference to its parts (the true, atomic ADCEPs).",,,,,0,,,,,
"Such an ADCEP is called a Compound ADCEP -- specifically, a compound attribute, compound derived attribute, compound domain, and so on.",,,,,0,,,,,
Referential attributes are always defrned in this way.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Common domains are created whenever two or more ADCEPs share a common domain of values, due to an essential similarity (not a coincidence).",,,,,1,,,,,
A primitive definition is one that does not reference other ADCEPs, its domain (if any) is explicitly stated via a domain specification.,,,,,1,,,,
"The domain specification is not checked by teamwork, but does adhere to a rigorous syntax amenable to mechanical checking by auxiliary programs.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The format of the domain specification varies, depending on the kind of domain being described: enumeration, subtype indication, string, numeric, or integer.",,,,,1,,,,,
"However, all formats begin by indicating which of these five domain specifications follows (‘Type”).",,,,,0,,,,,
Enumerable domains are defined simply by listing the valid values.,,,,,0,,,,,
"An attribute in a supertype which names the subtype object class is called a subtype indication, and its domain of valid values is, by definition, the object ids of the subtype object classes.",,,,,1,,,,,
"An ADCEP whose domain of valid values is strings of characters may be defined by a maximum size, minimum size, legal characters and/or format (if any).",,,,,1,,,,,
The description of a string ADCEP may have to include an English description of its required format in order to be precise.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Numeric ADCEPs are described by range and accuracy, as in the following examples.",,,,,0,,,,,
Such material was not uncovered during the analysis process.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The attributes of an object class are listed inside the object class rectangIe on the OCRD, below a line of dashes.",,,,,,0,,,,
Several conventions were followed zegarding the representation of behavior via State Transition Diagrams (STDs).,,,,,,0,,,,
These include conventions which relate to the construction of state and transition labels and are explained in detail below.,,,,,,0,,,,
Line 2 consists of a separator line to improve readability, note that this line is enclosed in a comment block which begins after the state name.,,,,,,0,,,
"Below this appear the enabled processes, in the usual “E.” notation.",,,,,,0,,,,
An id number for the state appears in the lower left comer.,,,,,,0,,,,
Words are separated with spaces rather than underscores (“-”).,,,,,,0,,,,
A transition is a change from one state to another state due to a particular event.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The state from which a transition is drawn is referred to as the source stare; the state to where it goes, the next state.",,,,,,0,,,,
The source state of a transition is said to “contain” that transition.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Every transition has either an event bZock or a guard (or both), and may additionally have a response (ordered sequence of triggered processes and signalled events).",,,,,,0,,,,
Transition labels have been augmented in several ways in order to simplify otherwise busy STDs.,,,,,,1,,,,
"A standard STD (i.e., a standard OOA STD) modified according to these conventions will generally have fewer transition lines and/or fewer state boxes.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Please , however, that the meaning of both diagrams is the same (Le., the behavior specified is identical): the purpose of these conventions is to increase readability only.",,,,,,0,,,,
The transformation from an augmented to a standard version of a given STD is mechanical.,,,,,,0,,,,
A slash (“/”) and a separator line follow the event block whenever a guard and/or response follow.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The guard, when present, is always preceded and followed by a separator line, and always appears before the response (if any).",,,,,,1,,,,
"The response, when present, always appears last, below a separator line.",,,,,,1,,,,
Conventions relating to transition event blocks and guards are described below.,,,,,,0,,,,
No special conventions were adopted for the response on a transition.,,,,,,0,,,,
An event block consists of a list of everu names and/or boolean expressions.,,,,,,0,,,,
Each item must be separated by the key word “.or.”.,,,,,,0,,,,
A transition which has a boolean expression in its event block is referred to as an evaluated transition.,,,,,,1,,,,
"When more than one item is listed, the transition is taken to be a shorthand for a set of transitions (one for each item) which share the same source state, next state, guard and response.",,,,,,1,,,,
A step in the construction of the standard version of an STD is to replace such a transition with just that set.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The event name carries the usual meaning: when an object of the class is in the source state, and the named event occurs, then the transition will be taken (unless the transition’s guard is false -- see below).",,,,,,1,,,,
A boolean expression is a series of one or more relational expressions separated by “.or.yy and/or “.and.”.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Each relational expression compares an attribute or derived attribute of an object to that of another (or to a constant) via using “.not.”, and may consist simply of an attribute or derived attribute name, so long as its domain is boolean.",,,,,,0,,,,
The boolean expression becoming true while the object is in the source state is treated as an event in the usual sense.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Upon entry into a state which contains one or more evaZuuted transitions, each of the boolean expressions must be evaluated (in any order), and the associated transition taken immediately if the guard evaluates to true; none of the enabled processes associated with the state shall begin until after all of these boolean expressions have been evaluated as false.",,,,,,1,,,,
"This stipulation is extremely important, especially in light of the infinite speed with which an essential (technology independent) process is said to execute.",,,,,,0,,,,
"It is possible to create non-deterministic state models using evaluated transitions; however, it is also possible to create non-deterministic state models using standad OOA state models in which states contain multiple processes that evaluate criteria and signal events (refer to the paragraph below).",,,,,,0,,,,
"It is up to the analyst, as usual, to ensure the correctness of the state model, which may or may not mean ensuring that the model is deterministic.",,,,,,0,,,,
All transitions going into the original state would be redirected to the specially-created state.,,,,,,0,,,,
"When one of the events occurs, or when one of the boolean expressions evaluates to true, it is said that an event in the event block has occurred.",,,,,,1,,,,
"A transition containing a guard is r e f e d to as a guarded event transition, and cannot be taken unless the guard evaluates to true at the time an event in the event block occurs.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If the guard evaluates to false, then the transition is not taken: the event in the event block is ignored.",,,,,,1,,,,
It is pennissable for a guard to appear on a transition which has no event block.,,,,,,1,,,,
"However, in this case, the guard is treated as an event block consisting of single boolean expression.",,,,,,1,,,,
See Conventions for Transition Event Blocks for more on boolean expressions.,,,,,,0,,,,
"As with evaluated transitions, the evaluation of the boolean eqwession can be relegated to a specially-created process which signals one of two specially- created events.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Any guarded event transition would be modified by removing its original response and changing its next state destination to a specially-created “temporary evaluation” state which would enable the specially-created process, and would contain two transitions: one going back into the source state of the original guarded event transition, with null response (for the “false” event), and one going ahead into the original next state of the original guarded event transition, with response equal to that of the original.",,,,,,0,,,,
Part of the specification of a process may be to generate particular events when certain conditions are met.,,,,,,0,,,,
"In this case, the process is shown to produce the event by means of a dotted arrow notation.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Other than this, no special conventions were adopted for Process Model diagrams.",,,,,,1,,,,
Several conventions were followed regarding the representation of relationships in the analysis.,,,,,,0,,,,
"These include some which relate to the building of a name for a relationship, its definition, and its appearance on diagrams.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Throughout the discussion of these conventions, please refer to Figure 5.3, which shows an annotated example &om the OCRD.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Every relationship has an id, two names, two statements of multiplicity, and a relationship itself.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Each name (as well as each statement of multiplicity) is defined from the viewpoint of one of the object classes, so that one can refer to the subject and object of the name (or statement of multiplicity), in the grammatical sense of these words.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The relationship’s definition documents the precise details of a relationship, expanding on the meanings signified by the relationship as it appears on the Object Class Relationship Diagram (OCRD).",,,,,,0,,,,
The official relationship name consists of two parts: the relationship name id and the basic name.,,,,,,0,,,,
The relationship name id is always present, it uniquely identifies one of the two m e s for the relationship.,,,,,,0,,,
It is always formed by appending ‘A’ or ‘By to the relationship id.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Each relationship is assigned a unique id of the form ‘Rnn’ (e.g., R01, R02, R23, R46), referred to as the relationship id.",,,,,,0,,,,
This id is the only way teamwork will refer to the relationship.,,,,,,0,,,,
Keep this in mind when reading teamwork-generated reports and listings.,,,,,,0,,,,
Teamwork uses this id (and only this id) to alphabetize.,,,,,,0,,,,
The basic name of the relationship is always a verb or verb phrase.,,,,,,0,,,,
It signifies the meaning of an association between members of the two object classes from the viewpoint of a generic member of the subject object class.,,,,,,0,,,,
The precise meaning attached to the association is documented in the relationship definition (see Conventions for Relationship Definitions).,,,,,,0,,,,
"These verb phrases might use the word “may” to underscore the conditionality of the relationship, though not always.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The statement of multiplicity follows a straight-forward, teamwork-imposed syntax.",,,,,,0,,,,
"It documents half of what is conventionally called the ‘multiplicity of the relationship’: the minimum and maximum number of objects in a class (the object object class) which might be associated, at any one time, with an object of the subject object class, defined from the viewpoint of a generic member of the subject object class.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The other half of the ‘multiplicity of the relationship’ is documented in the other statement of multiplicity, in which the two object classes have reversed grammatical roles.",,,,,,0,,,,
"For an example, refer to Rendering an English Definition From OGRD Relationships.",,,,,,0,,,,
A textual plain-English relationship definition need not be given unless the definition will illuminate subtle aspects of reality or policy not obvious from the relationship as documented on the Object Class Relationship Diagram (OCRD).,,,,,,0,,,,
"As shown in Figure 5.3, most aspects of a relationship are documented on the OCRD; only the definition is absent.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The definition serves to clarify the terse, Recall that a relationship name is either a verb or a verb phrase.",,,,,,0,,,,
"As shown in the figure, each name appears next to the object class which is the object of the verb phrase (in the grammatical sense), as is customary when using two names.",,,,,,0,,,,
"For example, the relationship name which is derived from the viewpoint of a “WPT-Waypoint” is placed next to the object class rectangle for “FP-- Flight-Plan”; the former object class is the subject object class, the latter the object object class.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The Statement of multiplicity which appears next to each relationship name follows a self-evident, teamwork-imposed syntax.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The statement of multiplicity appears adjacent to the object object class, and is defined from the viewpoint of a generic member of the subject object class.",,,,,,0,,,,
"As shown, the relationship name and statement of multiplicity appear together, generally on a single line.",,,,,,0,,,,
The Elationship name is enclosed in a comment block, teamwork does not perform any checking of this name.,,,,,,0,,,
"However, teamwork does inspect and expect statements of multiplicity.",,,,,,0,,,,
The relationship id appears inside the relationship diamond.,,,,,,0,,,,
"It generally helps the rr=ader of an OCRD gain an understanding of the meaning of a relationship by reading all parts together in two sentences, as follows.",,,,,,0,,,,
Read the name of one of the object classes, an object class is always named in the singular.,,,,,,0,,,
Read the relationship name (verb phrase) which is next to the other object class.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Read the name of the other object class, treating it as the object of the verb (in the grammatical sense), switching to the plural form for one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.",,,,,,0,,,,
Repeat this process from the other direction (starting with the other object class).,,,,,,0,,,,
This section contains the actual requirements specification for the TSRV flight control system (see Section 4 for a system description).,,,,,,0,,,,
"Although strictly speaking it is self-contained, any specification is best understood in the proper context.",,,,,,0,,,,
A key to a good understanding of the specification is an understanding of the typographical conventions used in it.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Qf course, it is also imperative to understand the concepts of Object Oriented Analysis (OOA).",,,,,,0,,,,
The scope of the requirements definition contained herein is limited to the Flight ManagemenVFlight Control computer functionality.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Within the scope of the system analyzed, some requirements were identified but not thoroughly analyzed.",,,,,,0,,,,
"In this analysis, such requirements were captured by identifying special placeholder object classes.",,,,,,0,,,,
Such an object class is termed a “pseudo external object class”: treated as external until such time as this aspect of the system can be analyzed further.,,,,,,0,,,,
"For the interim, this object class provides a source and sink for closely related events and data: those known to be required by objects already defined in the analysis.",,,,,,0,,,,
Further analysis may reveal that this single placeholder must become several object classes.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Also, several of these pseudo external object classes might be split andjoined.",,,,,,0,,,,
The requirements specification is divided into four sub-sections.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The requirements contained in the class level models are laid alphabetical &r. out in a format geared for maximum readability, although 5.3 and 5.6 may be useful in understanding the various products of OOA and the conventions used for the various pieces of a specification, respectively.",,,,,,0,,,,
The layout of these level products of OOA are descxibed below.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Each object class is defined within its own paragraph, 6.1.11 (where ‘n’ is a number): its Data Model, Behavior Model, and Rocess Mo&l are documented.",,,,,,0,,,,
The title to paragraph 6.1.n consists of the official mme of the object class.,,,,,,0,,,,
Immediately following this title is the object class description.,,,,,,0,,,,
"If the object class has a Behavior and/or Process Model, the Behavior Model Diagram and/or Process Model Diagram appear after Definitions.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Summary consists of a summary of the object class: all attributes, derived attributes, events and processes are listed here without being defined.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Also included is the primary identifier of the object class, along with any aliases by which the class is known.",,,,,,0,,,,
"If the object class has a Behavior or Process Model, su zh is indicated.",,,,,,1,,,,
Definitions contains all of the textual definitions relevant to the object class.,,,,,,0,,,,
"It defines the attributes, derived attributes, events and processes (in this order).",,,,,,0,,,,
"Thus the Data Model is completely contained in Definitions (and is summarized in Summary), while just the textual def~tions associated with the Behavior Model and Process Model appear.",,,,,,0,,,,
These diagrams document essential information, they are not mere summaries of information present e1sewheI.e in the specification.,,,,,,0,,,
"However, every item referenced on these diagrams is defined textually in Definitions of the source object class specification.",,,,,,0,,,,
"With respect to the STD, signalled events, mggered processes and enabled processes are listed in Summary, and defined in Definitions.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Consumed events are defined in the source object class specification, as are attributes and derived attributes appearing in boolean expressions.",,,,,,0,,,,

"A given strip of pavement (airstrip) plays the role, at different times, of two distinct Runways (e.g., 1OL and 28R).",,,,,,0,,,,
Thus the term “Runway” refers to one of the roles played by an airstrip rather than to the physical airstrip itself.,,,,,,0,,,,
The name of the Airport at which this Runway is located.,,,,,,0,,,,
The location on the surface of the earth over which the pilot must make his go-around decision.,,,,,,0,,,,
"This is the official name of the Runway, which is determined by (1) its Magnetic-Heading, and (2) its position at the Airport relative to a runway parallel to it (if one exists).",,,,,,0,,,,
"In the format “nh”, ‘n’ is a sting of degrees; ‘h’ is either “L” OT “ R (for left-hand runway and right-hand runway, respectively).",,,,,,0,,,,
"If there is no parallel runway, then the ‘h’ is dropped.",,,,,,0,,,,
Some of the data provided by the Sensor-Suite may be simply “passed through”.,,,,,,0,,,,
The mapping from sensed data to SDF data is non-trivial.,,,,,,0,,,,
The array of inputs from the sensor suite is not known at the time of this writing.,,,,,,0,,,,
"This is the instantaneous longitudinal acceleration of the aircraft, where forward acceleration is positive.",,,,,,1,,,,
"This is the instantaneous lateral acceleration of the aircraft, where acceleration towards the right wing is positive.",,,,,,1,,,,
"This is the instantaneous ""vertical"" acceleration of the aircraft, where the vertical axis completes the right-hand coordinate system of the aircraft.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The Sensor-Suite is a placeholder, an external object class used to provide a s plified source of sensed data until such time as this aspect of the system can be analyzed further.",,,,,,0,,,,
The a m y of data provided by the Sensor-Suite (to the SDF) is not known, hence there are no definitions given for this object class of any &rived attributes.,,,,,,0,,,
"Rather, this object class serves merely to document the existence of some set of raw data, which can be used to derive the set of data provided by the SDF.",,,,,,0,,,,
Note that external object classes which have already been modeled provide their own sensed data.,,,,,,0,,,,
The SENS object class exists as a “catch-all” for sensed data which does not have a clear source at the time of this writing.,,,,,,0,,,,
This is due to the fact that the system shall give maximum flexibility to the pilot as he or she constructs a Flight-Plan.,,,,,,1,,,,
Maximum flexibility manifests itself as very generic behavior and processing for SIDs and STARs.,,,,,,0,,,,
A Standard_Instrument_Departure_Procedun: is officially referred to as a SID.,,,,,,0,,,,
A SDD is a published IF’R ATC departure procedure established by the FAA.,,,,,,0,,,,
SIDs exist to reduce communication in the terminal area of an airport by providing a predefined transition route from a particular Runway to an appropriate en route structure.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The ss-1-Name shall be the official, published SID name.",,,,,,0,,,,
STAR is a published IFR ATC arrival procedure established by the FAA.,,,,,,0,,,,
STARs exist to reduce communication in the terminal area of an airport by providing a predefined transition route from an en route structure to a particular Runway.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The ss-1-Name shall be the official, published STAR name.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Note that combining SIDs and STARs into a single SS object class did introduce a couple “wrinkles”: the introduction of the “Type” attribute, and the transitive dependence of “IAS Required“ on the key.",,,,,,0,,,,
"However, the savings in terms of reduced complexity provided the impetus.",,,,,,0,,,,
The Stabilizer is one of the aerodynamic control effectors used to control the motion of the aircraft.,,,,,,0,,,,
"A Terrain Object known to the system can appear on a map display, for instance, or be used to validate a flight plan.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The TPG, while engaged, generates steering commands that direct the aircraft to, and maintain it on, the time projection of the Flight-Plan.",,,,,,1,,,,
The TPG assumes the aircraft is near the leg between the first two waypoints of the flight plan.,,,,,,0,,,,
This is the commanded airspeed which the aircraft shall attain.,,,,,,0,,,,
"This process steers the aircraft to, and maintains it on, the time projection of the active flight plan.",,,,,,0,,,,
The VCWS allows the AFD-Crew to change the velocity-vector-being-maintained by responding to wheeYcolumn inputs (or equivalent control inputs) while engaged.,,,,,,0,,,,
This process makes the selected velocity vector (flight path angle and ground track angle) of the aircraft equal to the instantaneous actual velocity vector.,,,,,,0,,,,
"This process commands the Effector-Controller to maintain the selected velocity vector (flight path angle and ground track angle) of the aircraft, while at the same time allowing the Aft Flight Deck Crew to modify this selected velocity vector via control inputs.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The VFG, while engaged, generates steering commands that direct the aircraft to, and maintain it on, the vertical projection of the Flight-Plan.",,,,,,1,,,,
The VPG assumes the aircraft is near the leg between the first two waypoints of the flight plan.,,,,,,0,,,,
This is the commanded vertical acceleration which shall be attained.,,,,,,0,,,,
This event corresponds to a determination that the VPG can successfully capture the vertical component of the flight plan.,,,,,,0,,,,
This event corresponds to the self-disengagement of the VPG.,,,,,,0,,,,
This event corresponds to a determination that the aircraft is physically moving toward the vertical projection of the flight plan.,,,,,,0,,,,
This event cornsponds to a determination that the aircraft is physically moving away from the vertical projection of the flight plan.,,,,,,0,,,,
This process determines whether the VPG can successfully capture the vertical component of the flight plan.,,,,,,0,,,,
"This process determines whether the VPG must disengage, that is, release control of the aircraft.",,,,,,0,,,,
"This process determines whether the aircraft is progressing towards the first path of the active flight plan, raising a signal if not.",,,,,,0,,,,
"This process steers the aircraft to, and maintains it on, the vertical projection of the active flight plan.",,,,,,0,,,,
It captures the information relevant to such an association.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The same Waypoint on a different Company Route may be assigned different data “Waypoint on a Company Route” is a somewhat artificial term created for the sake of clarity in this analysis; in general usage, the term “Waypoint” may refer to Waypoints, Waypoints on Company Routes, Waypoints on Flight Plans, or even Waypoints on SIDs or STARS (where the meaning is clear from the context).",,,,,,0,,,,

This process allows the creation and deletion of Waypoints.,,,,,,0,,,,
"If the Waypoint is &fined by the pilot via reference to existing Waypoint(s) (e+, SPO/30/30 or SPO/180/EAT/270), then the pilot-entered reference shall be used as the name.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Likewise, if the Waypoint is defined by the pilot via latitude and longitude coordinates, then these coordinates shall be used as the name.",,,,,,1,,,,
Note that pilots may not create ATC-- Named-Waypoints.,,,,,,0,,,,

This sub-section documents the system level models (see 5.3.2): the Object Class Relationship Model and the Object Class Communication Model.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The existence relationships among object classes 511.e documented via the Object Class Relationship Diagram (OCRD) and, where further clarification is needed, with textual definitions.",,,,,,0,,,,
"In the case of the TSRV flight control system, the OCRD suffices to specify the relationships.",,,,,,0,,,,
Please note that a complete understanding of the relationships depicted in the OCRD depends on one’s understanding of the graphical conventions employed.,,,,,,0,,,,
Only those object classes r e l a t e d t o other object classes a r e shown here.,,,,,,0,,,,
"In the case of the TSRV flight control system, the approach was to develop multiple communication di each focusing on a related subset of the communications in the system.",,,,,,0,,,,
"In order to maximize the scope of analysis on this project, the development of OCCDs was given a low priority, and only an example OCCD was generated.",,,,,,1,,,,
The OCCD shown in Figure 6.2 specifies the communication among the objects relating to the higher level flight modes.,,,,,,0,,,,
"This sub-section is intended to aid in determining where an identifier is defined or referenced Here “identifier” refers to the names of object classes, attributes, &rived attributes, events, processes and common domains.",,,,,,0,,,,
This index includes entries for every significant piece of an identifier.,,,,,,0,,,,
"For instance, the attribute “althmc-l-Selected-Altitude” appears in the index under its full name as well as “l-Selected-Altitude”, “Selected-Altitude” and “Altitude”.",,,,,,0,,,,
A definition of a subset of the NASA Transport System Research Vehicle (TSRV) flight control system essential requirements was developed using the Boeing developed Object Oriented Analysis (OOA) requirements analysis methodology.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The scope of the analysis was limited to the functionality included in the Flight ManagementfFlight Control (FM/FC) computer which hosts the navigation, guidance, and flight control software.",,,,,,0,,,,
"In terms of depth, a significant portion of the essential requirements for the FM/FC software was specified with Data, Behavior, and Process Models.",,,,,,0,,,,
Some requirements need further analysis to be fully specified.,,,,,,0,,,,
Such requirements were captured via pseudo external object classes which serve as placeholders until they can be thoroughly analyzed.,,,,,,1,,,,
Follow-on research activities might begin with extending the scope of the analysis in terms of both breadth and depth.,,,,,,0,,,,
"In regards to depth, it would be beneficial to analyze the EM/FG software further to completely ferret out the essential requirements relating to portions of the flight control laws, the autoland capability, and the sensor data requirements.",,,,,,0,,,,
This process may result in the specification of additional object classes and/or modifications of those already identified.,,,,,,0,,,,
"In regards to breadth, additional analysis might address the quirements for the on-line simulated airplane capability, the interfaces to other research flight deck systems (e.g., the IC, HOLD, and RUN operating system modes), and the displays.",,,,,,0,,,,
The specification of the display system requirements could be addressed in at least two ways.,,,,,,0,,,,
One approach would be to perfom an analysis of the Displays host computer software functions similar to that of the analysis documented in this report.,,,,,,0,,,,
The essential functionality could be integrated appropriately with the FM/FC functionality specified in this report or as extended per the abve recommendations.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Alternatively, the requirements implemented in the displays host could be captured in a user interface document where the pilot(s) and the other inflight test personnel are viewed as “users” of the system.",,,,,,0,,,,
"In this approach, the various pilot display formats and real-time data acquisition capabilities are considered to be a xesult of nonessential reformatting of the FM/FC essential data and could therefore be appropriately documented in a user interface document.",,,,,,0,,,,
The goal of another potential follow-on activity might be to formulate a more rigorous mapping of the essential system requirements to the existing implementation.,,,,,,0,,,,
This might take the farm of m m detailed Process Model mini- specs or merely some degree of cross-referencing of an essential system specification to the existing software documentation.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Such a mapping might provide a better understanding of the current TSRV flight control system, however, a design focused specification could hinder innovative architecture development of a new system.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Also, the complexity of an object-to-code mapping may limit its usefulness.",,,,,,0,,,,
A final recommendation for future research addresses the development of alternate more advanced software architectures for modem transport flight control systems.,,,,,,0,,,,
Architecture trade studies may be conducted on the system defined in this report or on any of its enhancements described above.,,,,,,0,,,,
"In particular, artificial-intelligence based real-time architectures and related functions with expert systems, innovative integration of numeric and symbolic processing, the real-world technology-based requirements associated with failure modes and reliability issues, and the appropriate use of parallel and distributed processing.",,,,,,0,,,,
"In summary, the essential system requirements specification presented here offers high visibility of the TSRV flight control system and may be readily extended to capture an increased set of existing system functionality and/or may be easily modified to accommodate new features, e.g., ones using expert system concepts.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The Object Oriented Analysis methodology proved to be an effective approach to distill the essential requirements of a complex, integrated system and the information centered strategy was a useful one for backing out the requirements of an existing system.",,,,,,0,,,,

In-situ LST have been derived for the period 2004-2013 and are already available at the time of writing this report.,,,,,,0,,,,
The ESA DUE GlobTemperature Technical Specification for land surface temperature (LST) provides the framework for the project.,,,,,,0,,,,
"It scopes the user needs and thus the development of GlobTemperature output datasets, tools and documentation to firstly evaluate these outputs and then to deliver them to the user community.",,,,,,0,,,,
"A quantified set of Technical Specifications have been determined to both guide the Project, and to facilitate an assessment of its success.",,,,,,0,,,,
The process for deriving these specifications can be summarised.,,,,,,0,,,,
"We took as input the set of User Requirements from the Requirements Baseline Document, and through analysis determined how the Project could meet each one and the most effective way of doing so.",,,,,,0,,,,
"This brief overview of how these requirements could be achieved was expanded upon in more detail in Sections 4.2, 5, 6, and 8.",,,,,,0,,,,
From these detailed accounts it has been possible to quantify a set of Technical Requirements which together fulfil the User Requirements.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Moreover, both the User Requirements and the subsequent Technical Specifications have been mapped onto the suite of GlobTemperature deliverables ensuring full traceability of how the requirements will be met by the Project.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Develop Climate Data Record of over 10-years for (A)ATSR in harmonised format with low bias, high precision, and high stability.",,,,,,0,,,,
As default datafiles to be disseminated with mandatory variables only.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The Technical Specification Document for the ESA DUE GlobTemperature project provides the framework for the project to follow in terms of the provision of user needs; the development of GlobTemperature output datasets, tools and documentation; the approach to assessing the success of the delivered output products through the mechanism of the User Case Studies; and the quality of these products through the application of a robust and traceable validation and intercomparison procedure.",,,,,,0,,,,
It will also consolidate a physical nomenclature to describe land surface temperature (LST).,,,,,,0,,,,
"More specifically, a summary of the user requirements and implications for LST; a determination and justification for the GlobTemperature product portfolio including a trade-off analysis, specifications of the products and web portal specifications; validation protocols and high level summaries of current results; and work plans for the user case studies.",,,,,,0,,,,
The backbone of the Technical Specification is to provide traceability from the User Requirements through to the delivered suite of GlobTemperature products.,,,,,,0,,,,
This document will be iterated with the International Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Working Group (ILSTE-WG) with feedback obtained following user consultation, with further releases therefore scheduled.,,,,,,0,,,
"Furthermore, it is expected that these aspects will directly contribute to all documents produced within the framework of GlobTemperature: the physical nomenclature (Section 2.1) will form part of the LST White paper (DEL-28) [AD-6]; the validation and intercomparison protocols (Section 5) will link such activities with the ILSTE-WG and with the LST White Paper [AD-6] - the protocols themselves appear both here (Section 5.1 and Appendix B – Detailed categorisation of the LST Validation GlobTemperature products.",,,,,,0,,,,
The User Case Study work plans provide the framework for which to channel resources in evaluating the value of the GlobTemperature products to user applications (Section .,,,,,,0,,,,
This document will additionally provide high-level summaries for the evolving GlobTemperature presentation pack for internal and more importantly for external use.,,,,,,0,,,,
The title of each main chapter is shown in Figure 1.,,,,,,0,,,,
An essential point is that the Technical Specifications Document has some important interactions which are also shown in the figure.,,,,,,0,,,,
"It is of particular note that a summary of the Requirements Baseline Document [AD-3] is an input to this document, as is the validation and inter-comparison protocol.",,,,,,0,,,,
The algorithm trade-off analysis summary (Section 6.3) GlobTemperature developments to provide recommendations for retrievals in GlobTemperature products, a full algorithm trade-off analysis is presented in [AD-5].,,,,,,0,,,
Physical nomenclature definitions (Section 2.1) will be iterated with the ILSTE-WG whose role will be also be defined.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Definitions include, amongst others, the following key parameters in land surface temperature: LST; land surface air temperature (LSAT); skin temperature; soil temperature; radiometric temperature; thermodynamic temperature; angular anisotropy; emissivity; biome; fractional vegetation cover; land cover class; satellite zenith angle; solar zenith angle.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Finally, the document concludes with a set of targets for GlobTemperature which include data set availabilities, publications, users, and international meetings and conferences.",,,,,,0,,,,
This is a living document in that further versions will include updates to the Technical Specifications based on feedback obtained throughout the life cycle of the Project.,,,,,,0,,,,
Such feedback will be collated following meetings of the International LST & Emissivity Working Group (ILSTE-WG) and the User Consultation Meetings (UCMs) thus providing a mechanism over which the Project will evolve to meet the requirements of the user community.,,,,,,0,,,,

A key aspect of GlobTemperature is to standardise terminology and data for ease of use by the user community.,0,,,,,,,,,
Section 2.1 details a first attempt at defining a common nomenclature for LST science.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The governance of such standardisation is to be overseen by an international group of LST experts, users of LST, and representatives of the space agencies (Section 0).",0,,,,,,,,,
This group will provide an independent source of advice and appraisal for LST documentations and data.,0,,,,,,,,,
"A variety of definitions exists for terms associated with the retrieval, validation and exploitation of land, lake and ice surface temperatures.",0,,,,,,,,,
No single resource exists which attempts to draw together all the applicable terms with community agreed definitions.,0,,,,,,,,,
The objective is for developers and users alike to utilise this nomenclature as a reference independent of satellite / airborne / ground instrumentation and retrieval methodology.,0,,,,,,,,,
"As a baseline, the definitions are first collated from the growing source of literature on LST.",0,,,,,,,,,
"For LST validation, for instance, several definitions are adopted from [RD-1], which is the standard for Metrology nomenclature.",0,,,,,,,,,
"In order to achieve community acceptance of the nomenclature presented here, the definitions are to be iterated with International LST & E Working Group (ILSTE-WG); this being a representative sample of the view of the wider data provider, LST expert, and user communities.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, liaison with the Land Product Validation (LPV) sub-group of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration and Validation (WGCV), both directly and through contacts within the ILSTE-WG aim to promote this nomenclature for inclusion in the first LPV “Best Practices Guide for LST”, which is still to be defined.",1,,,,,,,,,
"While some of these terms may be more qualitative than the more precise mathematical terminology as presented in [RD-1], their use is now so embedded in the psyche of the LST data provider and user communities it is pertinent to provide a unified definition of these terms so as to ensure consistency within this field.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Individuals who require a precise mathematical definition of thermal remote sensing properties, such as directional and hemispherical radiometric temperatures, or directional and hemispherical emissivities, are referred to [RD-2].",1,,,,,,,,,
Rather the objective here is to provide a nomenclature that both LST experts and LST users can identify and adopt to facilitate improved communication (addresses requirement REQ-28-TR).,0,,,,,,,,,
GlobTemperature will provide a foundation for collaboration and international progress.,0,,,,,,,,,
"To further advance these common themes, a new group has been founded with the support of GlobTemperature in its first three years.",1,,,,,,,,,
"WG) is becoming a truly international initiative providing a unifying, collaborative element in the LST community bringing together users with producers and providers of data.",0,,,,,,,,,
The ILSTE-WG has been founded jointly by a number of LST experts: representatives of NASA-JPL and members of the ESA GlobTemperature Team (specifically U. Leicester in the UK and IPMA in Portugal).,0,,,,,,,,,
The ILSTE-WG Steering Committee has been formed with agency representatives and LST experts and the first meeting was held on 6th June 2014.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The Steering Committee is responsible for agreeing the Terms of Reference of the Group, planning for the General Meetings, and providing the leadership.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The structure of the ILSTE-WG is presented in Figure 2, which additionally s early-identified projects, which would benefit from the oversight of the ILSTE-WG.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Further projects have been added to list, such as the ECOSTRESS Project run by NASA-JPL.",0,,,,,,,,,
General Meetings take place bi-annually alternating between Europe GlobTemperature User Consultation Meetings) and North America (during a large conference such as AGU), with Steering Committee teleconferences taking place every three to six months.,0,,,,,,,,
To address these themes a number of task-orientated groups are being considered.,1,,,,,,,,,
These would focus on such particular elements of LST and Emissivity work.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Where feasible, individuals external to the GlobTemperature Project Team from the ILSTE-WG General membership are identified and approached to review specific deliverables (deliverable sections).",1,,,,,,,,,
In the interest of international buy-in and cooperation the ILSTE-WG will also be a focus for review on other related international LST projects.,1,,,,,,,,,
"However, it must be stated that since the ILSTE-WG operates on a “best efforts” basis for most members the review of deliverables is entirely on the goodwill of international colleagues, and the maintenance and growth of the community takes priority.",1,,,,,,,,,
Current membership is outlined in Appendix A – International LST & E Working Group Membership.,0,,,,,,,,,
A primary purpose of the GlobTemperature Technical Specification is to document the strategy of delivering products which meet the requirements quantified following the User Requirements Survey.,0,,,,,,,,,
A key aspect here is traceability from these User Requirements through to the GlobTemperature outputs.,0,,,,,,,,,
In this section a brief overview of the User Requirements process is presented with the implementation detailed in Section 3.2.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The Requirements Baseline Document version 0 (DEL-05) [AD-3] undertook the following forms of assessment of user requirements for LST: review of previous user requirements documents including the NASA white paper on LST and Emissivity Needs [RD-12], the LST User Exploitation document [RD-13] and the Sentinel Convoy for Land Applications report [RD-14]; an evaluation of user requirements from the questionnaires completed during the first User Consultation Meeting for GlobTemperature (UCM#1) [RD-15]; and the development, distribution and analysis of a new survey on user requirements completed by eighty respondents across the globe.",0,,,,,,,,,
From this assessment a comprehensive list of user requirements for best practice in LST data provision was compiled.,1,,,,,,,,,
The User Requirements defined from the results of the User Survey have been augmented with updates following mini-questionnaires carried out during breakout sessions.,1,,,,,,,,,
The codes ‘TR’ and ‘BR’ in the requirement specification refer to ‘threshold’ and ‘breakthrough’ respectively, whereby threshold requirements indicate the limit beyond which data would be of no use for their application, and breakthrough requirements which indicate the level at which significant improvement to the given application would be achieved.,0,,,,,,,
Where questions did not permit different levels to be specified then requirements were considered to be at the threshold level.,1,,,,,,,,,
It is pertinent here to briefly summarise the methodology for determining these requirements.,0,,,,,,,,,
To assess whether a GlobTemperature requirement could be quantified then three options were available.,1,,,,,,,,,
"First, the responses were evaluated to see whether a ‘hard’ requirement could be issued on the basis of 75 % or more of participants agreeing on a particular option or where a particular specification would satisfy to whether a requirement based on a majority response could be issued.",1,,,,,,,,,
This type of requirement is appropriate where respondents could only select a single response from a range of options.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Finally, if this type of requirement could not be issued, a decision could be made to construct a ‘soft’ requirement.",1,,,,,,,,,
This type of requirement was best suited to multiple choice questions where participants could select a range of options that they felt were applicable to their use of LST data.,1,,,,,,,,,
If none of these types of requirement could be constructed then no requirement was issued.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Once a requirement was identified then it was first checked against the outcomes of the first user consultation meeting (UCM#1) for agreement, differences or contradictions.",1,,,,,,,,,
Agreement and differences that are a natural refinement of the requirement were d in the comments column of the requirements table.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Where a contradiction occurred, the outcomes from both UCM#1 and the current survey were weighed to construct the final requirement, which was justified in the comments section of the requirements table along with a description of the discrepancy.",1,,,,,,,,,
This process described related to threshold levels specified by respondents.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Where the information was provided, the same process was reiterated with breakthrough level specifications.",1,,,,,,,,,
"These were also included in the requirements table but are acknowledged as currently being more difficult to meet than the threshold requirements, primarily due to limitations in instrument capabilities rather than data production.",0,,,,,,,,,

"Provide tools for data reading and sub-setting, data extraction on different grids, data compositing, generation of match-up datasets, data visualisation tools, data inter-comparison tools, data processing tools, data analysis tools, trend analysis and tools for visualisation and evaluation of data uncertainties and quality.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Provide LST data from single sensors, instrument series and merged products.",0,,,,,,,,,
Provide merged data both with and without gap filling.,0,,,,,,,,,
Provide LST data at a spatial resolution of < 1 km.,0,,,,,,,,,
Provide data at a temporal resolution of 3 hours or less.,0,,,,,,,,,
Provide LST data with a precision of 0.1 K or better.,0,,,,,,,,,
Provide LST data with a stability of 0.1 K per decade or better.,0,,,,,,,,,
In each sub-section where the implementation of a requirement is described then this is clearly indicated to provide additional traceability.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Level-3 single-sensor datasets for (A)ATSR, Metop-AVHRR, and MODIS will be provided for day/night (12 hours) at standard temporal resolutions.",0,,,,,,,,,
Both the (A)ATSR single-sensor dataset and the (A)ATSR Climate Data Record will span over 10 years.,0,,,,,,,,,
The proposed harmonised format distinguishes between the different components of the LST pixel uncertainty.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Existing single-sensor datasets – AATSR [RD-16], MODIS [RD-17] and SEVIRI [RD-18] have been shown to produce LST data with a bias of ≤ 1 K. Each of these datasets will be disseminated via the GlobTemperature Data Portal in harmonised format.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, the objective of the (A)ATSR Climate Data Record is to reduce existing bias further.",0,,,,,,,,,
Existing single-sensor datasets – MODIS [RD-17] have been shown to produce LST data with a precision of ≤ 1 K. Both these datasets will be disseminated via the GlobTemperature Data Portal in harmonised format.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, the objective of the (A)ATSR Climate Data Record is to further improve precision.",0,,,,,,,,,
The (A)ATSR LST Climate Data Record aims to deliver a dataset with very high stability.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Quantification of this currently remains unknown, although the 0.3 K is seen as a minimum goal (for SST the ARC product has a stability of better than 0.05 K per decade).",0,,,,,,,,,
The proposed harmonised format for Level-2 products specifies cloud-screening information as a mandatory component of the Quality Control flags.,0,,,,,,,,,
The proposed harmonised format identifies surface emissivity assumed in the LST retrieval as an ancillary data field.,0,,,,,,,,,
"For single-sensor datasets which explicitly exploit surface emissivity in their retrieval, such as MODIS, this will be provided as mandatory information.",1,,,,,,,,,
The choice of netCDF-4 as the format preferred by the user community allows for high-level of internal compression of datafiles with no difference in read performance to uncompressed files.,1,,,,,,,,,
"As such, all Level-2 and Level-3 will be able to be provided with individual file sizes less than 200 MB.",0,,,,,,,,,
Access to LST data will be provided via dedicated FTP download from temporary user workspaces.,0,,,,,,,,,
"These temporary user workspaces will be created when users place bulk orders for data via the Data Portal, with files deleted after a period of two weeks.",1,,,,,,,,,
The aim for the demonstration NRT project is to provide the majority of data at the objective timeliness described in REQ-12-TR.,0,,,,,,,,,
Once a dataset is released to the user community via the Data Portal any further evolution of the algorithm and re-processing will be subject to a minimum period of one month being enforced between releases.,1,,,,,,,,,
In reality it is not foreseen that progressive releases of the same dataset will occur at such a high frequency as once a month.,0,,,,,,,,,
Users are currently being informed of upcoming events and new releases of components of the GlobTemperature Website / Data Portal and continuation of this to data availability and reprocessing is straightforward.,0,,,,,,,,,
The GlobTemperature User List is being maintained as new users are both identified externally and through registration via the GlobTemperature Website.,1,,,,,,,,,
Standard metadata are an important component of the harmonised format.,0,,,,,,,,,
Exact individual metadata will be iterated with the ILSTE-WG to ensure all metadata requirements are covered.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The Tier-1 and Tier-2 Merged LST Products will provide spatially averaged GEO, LEO and combined products at 0.05°.",0,,,,,,,,,
The Tier-1 combined GEO/LEO product will provide temporally averaged merged data at a resolution of 3 hours.,0,,,,,,,,,
Each dataset disseminated or linked from the GlobTemperature Data Portal will also contain a dedicated page describing the product with a breakdown of the Metadata.,0,,,,,,,,,
Each dataset disseminated or linked from the GlobTemperature Data Portal will also contain downloadable .pdf links of Product User Guides (PUGs) which will contain detailed descriptions of the Products and how to extract and exploit the data in the accompanying datafiles.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Tier-1 Merged LST Products will be gap-filled, and Tier-2 Merged LEO and Merged GEO LST Products will be provided without gap-filling.",0,,,,,,,,,
Single-sensor LST datasets will be provided as both level-2 (swath) and level-3 (gridded) products in the agreed harmonised format.,0,,,,,,,,,
For global gridded datasets equal-angle (regular latitude-longitude) is more suitable for global user applications and if user demand is sufficient will be provided at a broad set of resolutions defined in Section 6.5.5 to successfully meet the wide range of user requirements.,1,,,,,,,,,
For high latitude applications then equal area projections are more suitable and as such dedicated polar IST / LST datasets will be available in these projections.,1,,,,,,,,,
For the single sensor datasets Level-3 products will be averaged by day and night.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The Tier-1 combined GEO/LEO product will provide temporally averaged merged data at a resolution of 3 hours (at 0000, 0300, 0600, 0900, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2100 UTC).",0,,,,,,,,,
The single-sensor GEO datasets will also provide data at hourly resolutions or better meeting the requirement of data at the requested times.,0,,,,,,,,,
The single-sensor GEO datasets will provide data at hourly resolutions or better.,0,,,,,,,,,
All single-sensor LEO datasets will be provided globally in the agreed harmonised format.,0,,,,,,,,,
"In addition, GlobTemperature merged LST and the (A)ATSR Climate Data Record will also be provided globally.",0,,,,,,,,,
The common nomenclature detailed in Section 2.1 will be provided to the user community via the GlobTemperature Website.,0,,,,,,,,,
The common nomenclature is to be agreed with the ILSTE-WG.,0,,,,,,,,,
Uncertainty information is to be provided as mandatory in the harmonised format.,0,,,,,,,,,
For Level-2 datasets this amounts to total uncertainty on a pixel basis.,0,,,,,,,,,
In other words a single value per pixel that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurand.,0,,,,,,,,,
Optional uncertainty information allows the Data Provider to break this down into its component elements.,1,,,,,,,,,
"For higher-level products, as well as total grid cell uncertainty, the uncertainty information can be optionally disaggregated into random, synoptically correlated, and sampling components.",1,,,,,,,,,
As stated for REQ-29-TR uncertainty information is to be provided as the value that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurand rather than as confidence levels.,1,,,,,,,,,
Optional detailed cloud and confidence flags from Level-1b source data can also be provided for additional quality checks.,0,,,,,,,,,
Statistics of data comparison with reference to in-situ validation data and for satellite-to-satellite comparisons will be provided in the Validation and Intercomparison Reports available via the GlobTemperature Website.,0,,,,,,,,,
Such information will be averaged to Level-3 if available.,1,,,,,,,,,
The GlobTemperature Merged LST Product will resolve the diurnal cycle.,0,,,,,,,,,
Where data adjustment is performed this will be provided in the harmonised format as attribute comments.,1,,,,,,,,,
"REQ-33-TR Where available, land cover type, fraction of vegetation cover, albedo assumed in the retrieval and NDVI will be provided with LST data.",1,,,,,,,,,
All these fields are included in the harmonised format.,0,,,,,,,,,
"AATSR for example includes land cover type, fraction of vegetation cover and NDVI as standard.",0,,,,,,,,,
The proposed harmonised format for all LST products is netCDF-4.,0,,,,,,,,,
The uncertainty estimates for all GlobTemperature LST output products will be validated in addition to the LST data following taking guidance from the SST approach.,0,,,,,,,,,
The GlobTemperature Merged LST Product will be provided as both global and regional datasets.,0,,,,,,,,,
All datasets disseminated via the GlobTemperature Data Portal will have a full list of metadata accompanying the dataset as a page of information on the Data Portal.,0,,,,,,,,,
This will include descriptions of dataset length and coverage and a link to the main provider web page.,0,,,,,,,,,
"For each disseminated dataset in the harmonised format the GlobTemperature Data Portal will provide links to dataset validation reports, detailed descriptions of metadata – with links to download Product User Guides - and information on the dissemination options.",0,,,,,,,,,
"For LST data both FTP download, and interactive map services will be provided for acquiring LST data.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Python tools, which are platform independent, will be provided to read the LST data in their harmonised formats; such tools will allow for sub-setting.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The visualisation suite on the Data Portal will allow users to view data composited on different timescales, maps and time-series of data intercomparisons from the matchup database, and LST and LST anomalies.",1,,,,,,,,,
"GlobTemperature LST output products will include single-sensor datasets in harmonised format, datasets of the (A)ATSR instrument series (Climate Data Record), and Multi-Sensor Merged LST.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Tier-1 Merged LST Products will be gap-filled, and Tier-2 Merged LST Products will be provided without gap-filling.",0,,,,,,,,,
The GlobTemperature Data Portal will link to an external data centre for VIIRS Land Surface Temperature Environmental Data Record which has a spatial resolution of ~0.75 km (Section of the GlobTemperature Project.,0,,,,,,,,,
"However, the ASTER Global Emissivity Database (GED) contains climatology of mean LST at 100 m; a link to this this dataset will be provided from the GlobTemperature Data Portal (Section 4.2.12).",0,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, post-Project support of the Data Portal allows for the possibility of high resolution data being made available via this single LST portal.",0,,,,,,,,,
The (A)ATSR LST Climate Data Record aims to deliver a dataset with very low bias.,0,,,,,,,,,
The (A)ATSR LST Climate Data Record aims to deliver a dataset with very high precision.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Question thirty-eight of the User Requirements Survey, as detailed in the Requirements Baseline Document [AD-3], asked participants in which file format they would like LST data to be provided.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Respondents were only able to select one option; however, some indicated via the ‘other’ box that more than one file format was acceptable and information was been included in the responses where provided.",0,,,,,,,,,
The favoured file format is CF-Compliant NetCDF with 33 of 68 respondents selecting this option.,0,,,,,,,,,
The next nearest choice was HDF-EOS (which is standard format of MODIS products) with 16 participants expressing a preference for this format (Figure 3).,0,,,,,,,,,
"NetCDF format is a self-describing, portable, scalable, appendable, sharable, archivable, and machine- independent data format.",0,,,,,,,,,
"It is supported by all major data analysis and visualisation packages, such as for example IDL, Matlab, R, BEAM, Panoply, etc., and programming interfaces exist for a wide variety of other programming languages.",0,,,,,,,,,
"As such, CF-compliant netCDF-4 is the proposed format for all GlobTemperature data products (addresses requirement REQ-34-TR).",0,,,,,,,,,
The exact description of the proposed format is presented in Section 6.5.,0,,,,,,,,,
To ensure data file sizes remain manageable it is further proposed that all GlobTemperature data products are internally compressed to the highest level (level 9) possible (addresses requirement REQ-10-TR).,1,,,,,,,,,
There is no detriment to the performance of reading these datafiles by implementing the highest-level of internal compression, the compression of the datafiles instead only impacts the initial writing of the datafiles and is thus borne internally by the Project rather than impacting the users.,1,,,,,,,,
"The distinct features of Level-2, Level-3, Level-4 and databases for multi-sensor validation and intercomparison necessitate minor enhancement to these grouped harmonised formats, but all based on core variables and common metadata.",1,,,,,,,,,
Standard metadata are indeed an important component of the harmonised format (Section 6.5.3).,0,,,,,,,,,
"A single file specification covering all metadata requirements will be implemented for GlobTemperature output datasets, with common naming conventions across Level- (addresses requirement REQ-16-TR).",0,,,,,,,,,
The CF (Climate and Forecast) metadata conventions are designed to promote the processing and sharing of files created in netCDF format.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The conventions define metadata that provide a definitive description of what the data in each variable represents, and the spatial and temporal properties of the data.",0,,,,,,,,,
"This enables users of data from different sources to decide which quantities are comparable, and facilitates (http://cfconventions.org/) [RD-19].",1,,,,,,,,,
"The finalised form of the CF-compliant netCDF-4 harmonised format is to be iterated with the ILSTE-WG, with user feedback provided through the User Consultation Meetings.",0,,,,,,,,,
The User Requirements (Table 4) defined from the results of the User Survey have been augmented with updates following mini-questionnaires carried out during breakout sessions thus satisfying the technical requirement GT-TS-4, these updates are recorded in Table 6.,1,,,,,,,,
Provide LST NRT data with timeliness for new observations of 12 hours.,0,,,,,,,,,
Provide LST long-term data record updates with a timeliness of 1 month for new observations.,0,,,,,,,,,
Provide dataset updates for reprocessing and algorithm development not more than quarterly.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Provide information on 2 m air temperature, aerosol affected pixels, the diurnal cycle and data adjustment, total column water vapour, wind speed and humidity.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Provide tools for data reading and sub-setting, data extraction on different grids, data compositing, generation of match-up datasets, data visualisation tools, data inter-comparison tools, data processing tools, data analysis tools, trend analysis and tools for visualisation and evaluation of data uncertainties and quality, time series extraction.",0,,,,,,,,,
Explore ways of sharing data reading and visualisation tools within the LST community.,0,,,,,,,,,
Provide a data download tool with the ability to screen data as a function of cloud cover prior to download.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Provide tiled data for L3, L4 and geostationary satellite products at 10 x 10 degree resolution.",0,,,,,,,,,
Provide LST NRT data with timeliness for new observations of 6 hours.,0,,,,,,,,,
Provide LST long-term data record updates with a timeliness of 48 hours for new observations.,0,,,,,,,,,
In addition both MODIS single-sensor datasets for Terra and Aqua will also span over 10 years.,0,,,,,,,,,
The SST CCI Project is deriving intercalibrated L1b AVHRR GAC data spanning 30 years.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Although outside the original framework of GlobTemperature, the project will investigate the potential exploitation of this L1b data stream to develop a future 30+ year LST data record.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The GlobTemperature NRT Merged LST demonstration product processed at IPMA’s operational chain, archived locally and made available via FTP through the GlobTemperature portal aims to provide timeliness for new data of less than 24 hours.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The objective will be set to 12 hours, although final timeliness will be dictated by technical feasibility.",0,,,,,,,,,
The only long-term datasets (over 10 years) being derived in GlobTemperature are for (A)ATSR and MODIS.,0,,,,,,,,,
The GlobTemperature “value-added” MODIS products will be developed with new observations aimed at timeliness within 1 month.,0,,,,,,,,,
Once a dataset is released to the user community via the Data Portal any further evolution of the algorithm and re-processing will be subject to a minimum period of quarterly being enforced between releases.,1,,,,,,,,,
In reality it is not foreseen that progressive releases of the same dataset will occur at such a high frequency as quarterly.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Where the information is available, Level-2 single-sensor datasets in harmonised format will provide information on 2 m air temperature, total column water vapour, wind speed and humidity; with aerosol affected pixels as a QC flag.",1,,,,,,,,,
For time series extraction a tool will be developed tool that allows cloud filtering to provide data as both a plot and csv data file.,1,,,,,,,,,
A repository will be set up to allow users to share data reader and visualisation tools within the community.,1,,,,,,,,,
"A minimum set of required information will be requested of any user wanting to share their tools and the user must accept responsibility for ensuring the robustness, security and any licensing matters regarding the tools are satisfied.",1,,,,,,,,,
Maintenance of the tools do not lie within the remit of the GlobTemperature consortium.,0,,,,,,,,,
Cloud cover information provided within the QC flags of the GlobTemperature Products can be applied by the Data Portal facility prior to dissemination.,1,,,,,,,,,
This would though increase the waiting time for users to acquire the final data.,1,,,,,,,,,
All L3 and L4 data are provided as tiled datafiles with the nominal resolution chosen as 10° x 10°.,0,,,,,,,,,
The Geostationary data within the Merged product is also to be provided as tiled datafiles at this same resolution.,0,,,,,,,,,
The only GlobTemperature “operational” data product currently within scope is the NRT Merged Product demonstration.,0,,,,,,,,,
Since this requires data from multiple input data streams with considerable processing requirements such timeliness is not considered feasible.,1,,,,,,,,,
"However, once data from Sentinel-3 becomes available a NRT GlobTemperature LST Product for Sentinel-3 would be feasible within the remit of a CCN.",1,,,,,,,,,
Although much of the feedback obtained during UCMs are of a qualitative nature and thus not necessarily suitable for deriving User Requirements – which then drive Technical Specifications – such feedback is nevertheless pertinent to the direction of the Project, and indeed in the methods employed to deliver the most appropriate products to maximise exploitation.,1,,,,,,,,
"As such, where possible the response to this user feedback has been enumerated as GT-UFs and addressed throughout the Technical Specifications.",1,,,,,,,,,
There is an urgent need to better understand/characterise the relationships between i) observations of “all-sky” land surface air temperature (LSAT) and “clear-sky” thermal infrared (TIR) LST, and ii) TIR retrieved LST and microwave (MW) retrieved LST ensure including the “clear-sky” bias.,0,,,,,,,,
This needs to be communicated to the user community.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Metadata and/or documentation describing the uncertainty metrics, how the uncertainty value is calculated and how the data is processed.",0,,,,,,,,,
"While some users are more likely to adapt their existing tools, others would require the data provider to provide tools.",0,,,,,,,,,
"It should be d, that this weighting towards this request may partially be a result of the large numbers of urban participants following on from the EarthTemp meeting.",1,,,,,,,,,
There were numerous studies which highlighted the need for high quality LST data from polar- orbiting satellites with near daily global coverage spanning multiple years.,0,,,,,,,,,
"In this regards the MODIS LST, NOAA-AVHRR GAC LST, and Metop-AVHRR LST data should be prioritised.",0,,,,,,,,,
Cloud screening algorithms applied should be documented.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, filtering for cloud at the point of data download is seen as extremely relevant and was a tool that would be widely used.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Overall quality should be moved up in the QC since more important than the day/night flag, with a bit tool/decoder to produce a mask on the QC inserted into the extraction tool.",1,,,,,,,,,
It is suggested that daily files with global coverage would be useful with the possibility to download all the data as single zip-files.,0,,,,,,,,,
Improved folder structure can decrease download time such as one folder per year if there is only one file per day.,1,,,,,,,,,
Enable tiles to be aggregated into a single file when multiple are selected from an ROI selection.,1,,,,,,,,,
It was acknowledged that there is a time penalty in aggregation - that seems to be okay to prevent users from having to do it.,0,,,,,,,,,
We first describe the LST datasets currently being produced by the various space agencies.,0,,,,,,,,,
For each satellite sensor dataset a description of the satellite sensor is provided followed by a summary of the LST dataset algorithm.,0,,,,,,,,,
"This series consists of three instruments (ATSR-1, ATSR-2 and AATSR (Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer) on board the European Space Agency (ESA) sun-synchronous, polar orbiting satellites ERS-1 launched in July 1991, ERS-2 launched in April 1995, and Envisat launched in March 2002, respectively.",0,,,,,,,,,
All these instruments have used similar orbits and equator crossing times ensuring a high level of consistency - thus providing approximately 20 years of data.,1,,,,,,,,,
Continuation of this data will be sustained with the launch of the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) on board Sentinel-3.,1,,,,,,,,,
"AATSR has good radiometric accuracy of less than 0.1 K, which is achieved using Stirling Cycle coolers to maintain the infrared detectors in an optimal thermal environment.",1,,,,,,,,,
On board calibration was performed by utilising two blackbodies which were scanned once each scan cycle.,0,,,,,,,,,
"For LST retrieval the quoted target accuracy is 2.5 K during the day, and 1 K at night [RD-20].",0,,,,,,,,,
"For ATSR-1 the radiometric accuracy gradually deteriorated over the lifetime of the instrument as the detector temperatures increased, whereas for ATSR-2 good radiometric accuracy of less than 0.1 K was achieved over its lifetime.",1,,,,,,,,,
"However, no data were acquired from ATSR-2 between December 1995 and June 1996 due to the scan mirror anomaly; and the ERS-2 gyro failure in January 2001 affected the satellite's ability to maintain its normal stellar yaw-steering mode.",1,,,,,,,,,
A distinguishing feature of the ATSRs was the dual-angle (DA) capability (nadir and forward at an angle of ~55° to nadir).,0,,,,,,,,,
"However, only the nadir view is utilised in the standard ESA LST retrieval - this being a split-window (SW) algorithm in which 1 km LST is retrieved based on the infrared channels at 11 and land cover classes.",0,,,,,,,,,
"With a swath width of 512km, AATSR is able to provide approximately 3-day global LST coverage with a repeat cycle of 35 days.",1,,,,,,,,,
Potential exploitation of the DA view for LST has received little attention, although [RD-21] did assess both SW and DA over topographically flat and homogeneous rice fields and found DA algorithms to be less accurate.,0,,,,,,,,
In the case of the ESA standard (A)ATSR Level-2 LST (ESA_V3) product there are 13 land biome classes and one lake class at a spatial resolution of 0.5°.,1,,,,,,,,,
The SiB/ISLSCP fractional vegetation cover product and the precipitable water auxiliary data from the NASA Water Vapour Project (NVAP) climatology also have a spatial resolution of 0.5°.,0,,,,,,,,,
These latter two are composed of separate global datasets for each month of the year.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Issues relating to the auxiliary biome and fractional vegetation data utilised by the product were identified from validation, with the conclusion being that the resolution of these data were not high enough for their intended purpose [RD-23, RD-24].",1,,,,,,,,,
"As such substantial development under the ESA Long Term Land Surface Temperature Validation Project led by the University of Leicester has produced a significantly improved product (UOL_LST_2P) for AATSR [RD-16, RD-25].",1,,,,,,,,,
The ESA_V3 auxiliary datasets have been superseded with near 1 km data.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The new biome auxiliary data is a variant of the Globcover classification [RD-26], with the original 1/360° spatial resolution product having been re-gridded to 1/120°.",0,,,,,,,,,
"In addition, the original Globcover bare soil class has been divided into six separate classes, taking the total number of land and inland water classes to 27.",1,,,,,,,,,
"To incorporate these changes the Globcover nomenclature has been replaced, with the new classification system known as the ATSR LST Biome version-2 (ALB-2).",1,,,,,,,,,
In addition to the 27 land and inland water classes an additional biome class (ALB-2 class 0) is included for completeness and represents the ocean and large lakes – this corresponds to where the AATSR land- sea mask identifies a pixel as sea – whereby SST is retrieved rather than LST.,1,,,,,,,,,
Inland and coastal water (ALB-2 class 26) represents the remaining water - classified as land by the land-sea mask.,0,,,,,,,,,
Although the biome classification is invariant - being based on the 2006 Globcover product - on any given orbit every pixel including class 0 is assessed for snow and ice cover.,0,,,,,,,,,
Where snow or ice is identified the pixel is reclassified as permanent ice (ALB-2 class 27) and LST is retrieved by applying the associated coefficients.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Fractional vegetation cover is taken now from the Geoland-2 FCOVER dataset, which is available globally at the desired near 1-km resolution of 1/112° every 10-days from 1999 and acquired from a moving temporal window of approximately 30-day composites of observations [RD-27].",0,,,,,,,,,
The values of FCOVER are computed from leaf area index and other canopy structural variables available in the CYCLOPES (Carbon cYcle and Change in Land Observational Products from an Ensemble of Satellites) product using a neural network trained from the 1-D radiative transfer models SAIL and PROSPECT.,1,,,,,,,,,
The 10-day AATSR fractional vegetation cover auxiliary dataset is created from the FCOVER dataset with missing values gap-filled from climatology.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The standard ESA LST retrieval algorithm was implemented in version 5.58 of the AATSR Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) in March 2004, and in 2008 the archive was re-processed to include version 6.01 of the IPF.",0,,,,,,,,,
These standard products have been consistently processed to Level-2 LST utilising this same algorithm.,1,,,,,,,,,
UOL_LST_2P has been reprocessed from the L1b data following the ATSR 3rd reprocessing.,1,,,,,,,,,
"For IST, prior knowledge of the surface type is required in order to allow selection of the most suitable retrieval algorithm.",1,,,,,,,,,
The (A)ATSR IST dataset [RD-28] applies LST coefficients to retrievals over snow and ice.,1,,,,,,,,,
These coefficients have been regressed from radiative transfer modelling of permanent snow and ice surfaces utilising associated atmospheric profile and emissivity data.,1,,,,,,,,,
Where a surface is identified as transient snow/ice or sea-ice these IST coefficients are applied instead of the respective LST or SST coefficients.,1,,,,,,,,,
The variability of surface type dictates a requirement for a dynamic mask that demarcates snow/ice- covered areas from snow/ice-free areas in addition to the usual requirements for a land-sea mask.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, it is the differentiation of ice from cloud over both land and water using the data available from the instrument channels that can be the most challenging feature of IST retrieval.",1,,,,,,,,,
"For determination of the snow mask third-party ice extent data from OSTIA is used for sea-ice extent and over the land [RD-29] is used for daytime retrievals and IMS data for land-ice extent at night; the cloud mask is then an application of the UOL_V3 cloud clearing algorithm, which has been shown to perform well [RD-30].",1,,,,,,,,,
"Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) retrievals from ATSRs have been developed under the ESA project, ARC-Lake.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Earlier work [RD-31] established that LSWT retrieval using standard ATSR SST retrieval coefficients is prone, for some lakes, to retrieval biases of 0.5K.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Rather than specifying lake- specific retrieval coefficients and cloud clearing methods, which becomes less practical when considering all lakes resolvable by ATSR (> 1000), ARC-Lake uses optimal estimation (OE) retrieval and probabilistic (Bayesian) cloud screening techniques.",0,,,,,,,,,
"This methodology is generic (i.e. applicable to all lakes) as variations in physical properties such as elevation, salinity, and atmospheric conditions are accounted for through the forward modelling of observed radiances.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The ARC-Lake LSWT algorithm [RD-32] uses the radiative transfer model, RTTOV8.7 [RD-33], driven by the NWP profile for the state of the atmosphere from ECMWF, to simulate top-of-atmosphere brightness temperatures for ATSR.",1,,,,,,,,,
Prior surface temperature fields (on a 1/120° grid) for the forward modelling are derived iteratively from ATSR observations using empirical orthogonal function techniques to fill in gaps in the observations (e.g. clouds).,1,,,,,,,,,
"LSWT retrievals are performed at the ATSR level-1b pixel resolution using (where possible) dual-view 3-channel for night-time and dual-view 2- channel retrievals for day-time, before being averaged onto a 0.05° grid.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Currently, day and night-time ARC-Lake v2.0 LSWT products are available for 258 of Earth’s largest lakes (mostly of area exceeding 500 km2) from 1991 to 2011 [RD-34].",0,,,,,,,,,
Lake locations have been defined using a land/water mask derived from a combination of a 1/120° global gridded binary mask (NAVOCEANO) and polygon data from the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD) [RD-35].,1,,,,,,,,,
"Improvements in coverage and LSWT retrieval biases from ARC-Lake, compared to LSWTs from operational SST retrievals has been demonstrated as has the potential use of ARC-Lake LSWTs in climate applications [RD-36].",0,,,,,,,,,
The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/3) is an across track scanner that senses the Earth’s outgoing radiation from horizon to horizon: scan range of 55.37º and a swath width of about 1447 km.,0,,,,,,,,,
It provides global observations in the visible and infrared bands detailed in Table 8.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Although AVHRR/3 is a six-channel radiometer, only five channels are transmitted to the ground at any given time, since channels 3a and 3b do not operate simultaneously.",1,,,,,,,,,
"For Metop satellites, channel 3a is operated during the daytime portion of the orbit and channel 3b during the night-time portion.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The LSA SAF adopted a procedure for LST retrieval from AVHRR split-window channels similar to that described above for SEVIRI data, but taking into account AVHRR response functions.",0,,,,,,,,,
Again emissivity estimates are based on the so-called Vegetation Cover Method and atmospheric correction takes into account hourly forecasts obtained from the operational global ECMWF model.,1,,,,,,,,,
The AVHRR/Metop LST is first generated on a pixel-by-pixel basis.,0,,,,,,,,,
"A daily composite is then generated from the former, where LST is re-projected onto a regular (0.01) grid to form two regular fields (65ºS – not operational yet at the LSA SAF system; the respective operational readiness review is planned for the 1st quarter of 2015.",0,,,,,,,,,
The Special Sensor Microwave / Imager (SSM/I) sensors have been on board the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) polar satellites since 1987.,1,,,,,,,,,
"They observe the Earth twice daily at 19.35, which is for vertical polarization only.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The observing incident angle is close to 53°, and the elliptical fields of view decrease in size proportionally with frequency, from 43 x 69 to 13 x 15 km2.",0,,,,,,,,,
The local times of their descending and ascending modes are early morning and late afternoon respectively.,0,,,,,,,,,
There are up to 4 SSM/I instruments in space at the same time (with similar overpassing times).,0,,,,,,,,,
"A methodology has been developed to estimate the LST, along with atmospheric water vapour, cloud liquid water, and surface emissivities over land, from passive microwave imagers [RD-37].",0,,,,,,,,,
"It is based on a neural network inversion, trained on a large data set of simulated radiances, using real atmospheric and surface information over the globe.",1,,,,,,,,,
"It makes use of a first guess information about emissivity (pre- calculated directly from the satellite observations, [RD-38]), and coincident surface skin temperature (derived under clear sky condition from IR observations, through the ISCCP program, [RD-39]).",0,,,,,,,,,
"The method has been applied to the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager measurements, and LST have been estimated with a spatial resolution of 0.25°x0.25°, at least twice daily, depending on the number of SSM/I instruments in space.",0,,,,,,,,,
The theoretical RMS error of the LST over the globe is 1.3K in clear-sky conditions and 1.6K in cloudy conditions.,0,,,,,,,,,
"In the absence of routine in situ surface skin measurements, retrieved LST values have been evaluated by comparison to the surface air temperature LSAT measured by the meteorological station network [RD-40].",1,,,,,,,,,
"The LST-LSAT difference shows all the expected variations with solar flux, soil characteristics, and cloudiness.",0,,,,,,,,,
"After suppression of the variability associated to the diurnal solar flux variations, the LST and LSAT data sets show very good agreement in their synoptic variations, even for cloudy cases, with no bias and a global rms difference of 2.9 K. This value is an upper limit of the retrieval rms because it includes errors in the in situ data as well as errors related to imperfect time and space collocations between the satellite and in situ measurements.",1,,,,,,,,,
Results have also been evaluated over snow and ice surfaces and the results were consistent with surface air temperature [RD-40].,0,,,,,,,,,
"More recently, the microwave LST have been evaluated through a careful comparison with in situ measurements from the Coordinated Energy and water cycle Observations Project (CEOP) for 12 stations in different environments over a full annual cycle [RD-41].",0,,,,,,,,,
"Under clear sky conditions, the quality of our microwave neural network retrieval (TsMW1) is equivalent to the infrared ISCCP products, for most in situ stations, with errors ∼3 K as compared to in situ measurements.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The performance of the microwave algorithm is similar under clear and cloudy conditions, confirming the potential of the microwaves under clouds.",1,,,,,,,,,
"We showed that the LST accuracy does not depend upon the surface emissivity, as the variability of this parameter is accounted for in the processing.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) has similar characteristics to SSM/I, with the addition of low frequencies.",0,,,,,,,,,
AMSR was developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) with close cooperation of U.S. and Japanese scientists.,0,,,,,,,,,
"It was launched on board the Earth Observation Satellite Aqua, in May 2002 (AMSR-E).",0,,,,,,,,,
"AMSR-2, the AMSR-E follow-up, was launched on board the Japanese Global Change Observation Mission (GCOM) on May 2012.",0,,,,,,,,,
"AMSR measures horizontally and vertically polarized radiances at 6.9, 10.65, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89.0 GHz.",0,,,,,,,,,
It scans conically at a nominal 55° with a swath width of 1600 km.,0,,,,,,,,,
Spatial resolution of the individual measurements varies from 5 km at 89 GHz to ~50 km at 6.9 and 10.65 GHz.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Inversion procedure for the LST has been applied to AMSR-E, similar to SSM/I.",0,,,,,,,,,
Note that the overpassing time of AMSR is around midnight and midday (1h30 and 13h30 local time for AMSR-E).,0,,,,,,,,,
"The Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) is the main sensor onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG), a series of 4 geostationary satellites to be operated by EUMETSAT.",0,,,,,,,,,
"SEVIRI was designed to observe an earth disk with view zenith angles (SZA) ranging from 0o to 80o, with a temporal sampling of 15 minutes.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The High Resolution Visible (HRV, Table 9) channel provides measurements with a 1km sampling distance at the sub-satellite point (SSP); for the remaining channels the spatial resolution is reduced to 3km at SSP.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The nominal SSP is located at 0º longitude and therefore the MSG disk covers Africa, most of Europe and part of South America.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Level 1.5 data are disseminated to users after being rectified to 0o longitude, which means the satellite viewing geometry varies slightly with the acquisition time (satellite zenith angles typically differ by less than 0.25o between consecutive observations).",1,,,,,,,,,
The EUMETSAT Satellite Applications Facility on Land Surface Analysis http://landsaf.meteo.pt) produces an LST product based on SEVIRI data.,0,,,,,,,,,
"LST fields are available every 15 minutes, in near real time and off-line, covering the MSG disk centred at 0º longitude and with a spatial resolution of about 3km at the sub-satellite point.",1,,,,,,,,,
"LST is obtained by correcting top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances for surface emissivity, atmospheric attenuation along the path and reflection of downward radiation.",1,,,,,,,,,
The LST algorithm follows closely the generalized split window proposed by [RD- coefficients were calibrated for classes of viewing angle and total column water vapour (available from ECMWF as operational hourly forecasts).,0,,,,,,,,,
"The split-window algorithm requires values of channel emissivity at the surface, which are estimated as a weighted average of that of bare ground and vegetation elements within each pixel [RD-49, RD-50].",0,,,,,,,,,
This method produces emissivity values that are generally in line with those retrieved independently for other sensors [RD-52].,0,,,,,,,,,
The uncertainty of LST values is also estimated and distributed.,0,,,,,,,,,
"This depends on a number of factors [RD-47]: (i) the retrieval conditions in terms of atmospheric water content and viewing geometry, since the total optical path will strongly influence the performance of the generalized split-window algorithm; (ii) input uncertainties, including sensor noise, errors in the estimation of surface emissivity and in atmospheric total water vapour obtained from ECMWF forecasts; and (iii) errors in the cloud mask used to identify clear sky pixels.",1,,,,,,,,,
"For most regions within the MSG disk these values are below 2K and pixels with error bars higher than 4K, generally near the edge of the MSG disk, are masked out.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Validation of SEVIRI LST relies on comparisons with other satellite products (e.g., MODIS) and with in- situ measurements.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The latter generally reveal root mean differences between 1K and less than 2.5 K [RD-47, RD-50], depending on the surface (better agreement is generally found for sites located in homogeneous surfaces).",1,,,,,,,,,
The LSA SAF initiated the production of SEVIRI LST in February 2005.,0,,,,,,,,,
The first retrievals covered the European area and were later extended to the whole disk in July 2005.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Since then, the algorithm and input data were improved and therefore the LSA SAF team is planning a re-processing exercise to cover the full period of SEVIRI measurements (2003 onwards) with a single and most recent SEVIRI algorithm; the review to release the re-processed LST dataset is foreseen for the end of 2014.",1,,,,,,,,,
"MODIS instruments are part of the payload of two sun-synchronous, near-polar orbiting satellites Terra (EOS AM-1) launched on 18 December 1999 and Aqua (EOS PM-1) launched on 4 May 2002, respectively.",0,,,,,,,,,
Each instrument provides a pair of observations each day acquiring data in 36 spectral bands: for Terra-MODIS at approximately 10:30am (local solar time) in its descending mode, and at approximately 10:30pm (local solar time) in its ascending mode, for Aqua-MODIS at approximately descending mode.,1,,,,,,,
"The large swath width of these instruments, 2330km, enables these satellites to view almost the entire surface of the Earth every day.",1,,,,,,,,,
The spatial resolution of the thermal bands is 1 km, with both land surface temperature and land surface emissivity being core products from these instruments.,0,,,,,,,,
MOD11_L2 data is available from 5th March 2000 and MYD11_L2 data is available from 4th July 2002.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The generalized split-window (SW) algorithm [RD-10], similar to the split-window method used for AVHRR data, is used to estimate LST as a linear function of clear-sky TOA brightness temperatures from bands 31 and 32 centred on 11μm and correction being made to account for the satellite viewing angle.",1,,,,,,,,,
"MODIS LST data is accompanied by quality control flags, which include an indication of the presence of clouds.",0,,,,,,,,,
Previous collections of the LST products have suffered from cloud- contamination, the latest operational version - collection 5 - though includes refinements to account for surface elevation in the cloud masking algorithm, the resultant accuracy is reported as better than 1.0 K [RD-53].,0,,,,,,,
VIIRS is one of five instruments on board the sun-synchronous near-polar orbiting satellite Suomi NPP which was launched in October 2011 with an expected operational lifetime taking it into 2017.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Observations correspond to approximately 13:30 (local solar time) in its ascending mode, and with a swath width of 3040 km it achieves global coverage every day with a repeat cycle of approximately 16 days.",1,,,,,,,,,
It has a spatial resolution of ~375 m at nadir in the Imagery Bands and ~750 m at nadir in the Moderate Bands through a system of pixel aggregation techniques.,1,,,,,,,,,
VIIRS controls pixel growth towards the edge of scan such that the pixel sizes are comparable to nadir.,1,,,,,,,,,
The aim of NPP VIIRS is to extend and improve upon the heritage of AVHRR and MODIS while providing a bridge between MODIS and the operational JPSS VIIRS.,1,,,,,,,,,
Land surface temperature is one of several products being produced from VIIRS.,0,,,,,,,,,
VIIRS LST algorithms use brightness temperatures measured by VIIRS IR channels processed through physical regression methods to retrieve skin LSTs.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The baseline LST algorithm is a two-band, thermal split window algorithm based on a single equation for each land cover type, with an additional dual split window algorithm based on four thermal BTs (two middle infrared and two thermal infrared) bands that can be used when conditions are optimal, i.e. the measurements are unaffected by sun glint, with different algorithms for day and night.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The algorithms used in the VIIRS LST product do not require emissivity information, only knowledge of the land surface type - for which there are separate coefficients.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The algorithms require that the input BT values have a measurement accuracy of 2.4 K and a measurement precision of 0.5 K, the latter of which may not be met for some land types [RD-54].",0,,,,,,,,,
The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) Imager consists of a five channel radiometer covering visible and infrared bands of the spectrum (Table 10).,0,,,,,,,,,
NOAA/NESDIS operates two GOES satellites: GOES-W positioned over 135W and GOES-E over 75W.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The temporal sampling over the disk is not homogeneous: images over North America are available at least hourly, while South America is covered every 3 hours.",1,,,,,,,,,
"IPMA have generated LST from GOES imager data for the period between 2010 and 2012, within the framework of FP7 GMES project Geoland2.",0,,,,,,,,,
"From Jan 2013 onwards, IPMA is producing GOES LST in near real time, as part of Copernicus Global Land Initial Operations Service.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The algorithm used for GOES LST takes into account the information in the available channels and considers two different formulations used for night-time and daytime, respectively: (i) two-channel algorithms, which derive LST from one window channel in the thermal infrared – around 11 μm – and another in the middle infrared – around 3.9 μm (TTIR1 and TMIR, respectively); this is used for night-time conditions, when TMIR is not contaminated by solar radiation reflected by the surface; (ii) mono-channel method that corrects the TOA brightness temperature of a single channel, TTIR1, for atmospheric attenuation and surface emissivity; this algorithm is used for daytime conditions.",0,,,,,,,,,
"LST is estimated as a linear function of TTIR1 and TMIR (night) or of TTIR1 (day), using regression coefficients estimated for different classes of water vapour in the atmosphere, view angle and land cover types [RD-55].",1,,,,,,,,,
"GOES LST is estimated hourly on a pixel-pixel basis, together with an error bar which takes into account the algorithm expected uncertainty and propagation of input errors.",1,,,,,,,,,
The Multi-functional Transport Satellites (MTSAT) series of geostationary satellites is operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).,0,,,,,,,,,
"The imager onboard MTSAT is very similar to that of GOES, with 1 visible (VIS) band and 4 in the infrared: (i) middle infra-red (MIR); (ii) water vapour (WV); and (iii) two split-window channels in the thermal infrared (TIR1 and TIR2).",0,,,,,,,,,
"MTSAT is centred at 140 East, providing hourly coverage of most of Asia and Australia.",1,,,,,,,,,
The VIS data are available with a 1 km pixel sampling distance at nadir and 4 km for infrared channels.,0,,,,,,,,,
"IPMA have generated LST from MTSAT imager data for the period between 2010 and 2012, within the framework of FP7 GMES project Geoland2.",0,,,,,,,,,
"From Jan 2013 onwards, IPMA is producing MTSAT LST in near real time, as part of Copernicus Global Land Initial Operations Service.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Although the sensor onboard MTSAT has two channels in the thermal infrared atmospheric window (split-window channels), only one of these is relayed via EUMETCast.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, the algorithm implemented by IPMA to produce MTSAT LST is very similar to that described above for GOES.",1,,,,,,,,,
The coefficients of the regressions used were calibrated for MTSAT imager response functions [RD-55].,0,,,,,,,,,
The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) is a nadir viewing instrument flying operationally on MetOp satellites.,0,,,,,,,,,
"IASI is composed of a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) with a spectral sampling of 0.25 cm-1, and a spectral range of 645 to 2760 cm-1.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The IASI instrument utilises a step by step scanning mirror to achieve a swath width of 2200 km, and twice daily global coverage (>99 .",0,,,,,,,,,
The optical axis of the scanning mirror moves from 48.3o to +48.3o with respect to nadir.,0,,,,,,,,,
As IASI moves forward in its orbit a scan line is made of 30 Effective Fields of View (EFOV).,0,,,,,,,,,
"Each EFOV consists of a matrix of 2 x 2 IFOVs (Instantaneous Field of View), each with a diameter of 0.84± (11 mrad ≤d≤14:65 mrad) and with centres located at 15.3 mrad (0.88o) from the instrument optical axis.",0,,,,,,,,,
"On the ground, the EFOV is 50 km by 50 km at nadir, and the distance between two EFOV is approximately 50 km.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Each cell of the 2 x 2 matrix corresponds to a circular pixel of 12 km diameter at the sub-satellite point, and at the edge of the scan the across-track and along-track sizes of the individual pixel are 39km and 20 km respectively, with each of the 4 simultaneously imaged pixels utilising its own detector.",0,,,,,,,,,
"There are currently two IASI instruments flying operationally, onboard MetOp-A and MetOp-B.",0,,,,,,,,,
"IASI LST products are available at 12 km spatial resolution at the sub-satellite point, increasing to 39 km and 20 km at the swath edge in the across- and along-track directions, respectively.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The IASI Level 2 Product Processing Facility (PPF) is located at EUMETSAT headquarters in Darmstadt, producing operational products from MetOp (currently MetOp-A and MetOp-B).",0,,,,,,,,,
There also in eight decentralised satellite application facilities hosted by EUMETSAT member states.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The level 2 processing combines IASI data with concurrent measurements of the AVHRR, AMSU-A and MHS, which are flown together on MetOp, to aid cloud detection and the initialisation of the geophysical–parameters retrieval although IASI stand-alone processing is possible if other measurements are not available [RD-56].",1,,,,,,,,,
Version 5 of the PPF has a modular structure with IASI and auxiliary data first collocated in a pre-processing step.,0,,,,,,,,,
"After configuration of the retrieval algorithm with coefficients and thresholds adapted to the time and location of the measurements, cloudiness is determined, followed by the geophysical parameters, including LST from cloud-free scenes.",1,,,,,,,,,
The LST (and land surface emissivity) are currently taken from statistical retrievals [RD-57].,0,,,,,,,,,
"A collection of statistical methods are applied first, which include EOF linear and ANN non-linear regressions.",0,,,,,,,,,
"For the EOF analysis, principal component scores of the IASI radiances are computed and then input into the linear regression [RD-58].",1,,,,,,,,,
"GlobTemperature LST products include both single-sensor datasets, the multi-sensor merged LST datasets, and the (A)ATSR Climate Data Record.",0,,,,,,,,,
All datasets are to be disseminated to the users via the GlobTemperature Data Portal (or linked to external sites in the case of some operational datasets produced by other space agencies) in harmonised format.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Single-sensor LST datasets will be provided as both level-2 (swath) and level-3 (gridded) products in the agreed harmonised format, as will level-4 (merged) products whereby the optimum dissemination of higher level products is via 10° x 10° tiles (addresses requirements REQ-22-TR, REG-40-TR and REQ-44-TR).",0,,,,,,,,,
"The objective of data provision in GlobTemperature is to provide a one-stop-shop for all LST, IST, and LSWT data products.",1,,,,,,,,,
Thus third-party datasets will also be available via the Data Portal.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Since non- GlobTemperature funded international collaborators may be unlikely to be able to provide datasets in the agreed GlobTemperature harmonised format, the Data Portal will not restrict access to only datasets in harmonised formats.",1,,,,,,,,,
For such third-party datasets the Data Portal will provide a link to the external data centre and will include a descriptive page on the product metadata.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Although these datasets may be in non-harmonised format this is outweighed by the benefit to the user community of having a single point of access to all the major European and non-European LST, IST and LSWT datasets.",,0,,,,,,,,
"For the single-sensor LST dataset from the ATSR (ATSR-1, ATSR-2, and AATSR) series, this will be provided via the GlobTemperature Data Portal in the harmonised format (Section 6.5.1 and Section available on both the ESA archive and the CEDA archive in the UK) will be employed here for the GlobTemperature single-sensor (A)ATSR LST Product.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The harmonised format is slightly different, in terms of additional mandatory variables, from the format for UOL_LST_2P (although UOL_LST_2P was the baseline for the proposed harmonised format) since it is user-driven following the User Requirements Survey.",,1,,,,,,,,
"As such, level-1b data available on the CEDA archive (ftp.ceda.ac.uk) following the 3rd ATSR re-processing will be processed to LST data in the harmonised format on the UK CEMS facility exploiting its new 20 Tb GlobTemperature workspace.",,0,,,,,,,,
The level-2 harmonised format will use the latest probabilistic cloud clearing detection algorithm (UOL_V3) to generate a cloud masks which will be stored as a component of the Quality Control flag.,,0,,,,,,,,
A further particular inclusion in the GlobTemperature (A)ATSR LST single-sensor dataset is the uncertainty budget breakdown (addresses requirement REQ-4-TR), an example is illustrated in Figure 5.,,0,,,,,,,
Version 2.0 of the GlobTemperature (A)ATSR LST product assigns these individual components to a 3- component model which categories the uncertainty in terms of: i) uncertainties from random effects, ii) uncertainties from locally correlated effects, and iii) uncertainties from large-scale systematic effects.,,0,,,,,,
Such a categorisation is applicable across sensors and product levels.,,0,,,,,,,,
"This is the approach, which will be implemented, where feasible, in new GlobTemperature products, and updated versions of existing GlobTemperature products.",,1,,,,,,,,
Thus a consistent approach to providing uncertainty information is the objective.,,1,,,,,,,,
A full description will be provided in the Product User Guide (PUG).,,0,,,,,,,,
"The same algorithm and procedure will be applied to Level-1b data from each of the ATSR instruments independently, albeit with instrument specific response functions, retrieval coefficients and tuning parameters.",,0,,,,,,,,
The homogenisation of the brightness temperatures for the instrument series will be carried out in the development of the (A)ATSR Climate Data Record (Section 4.2.14).,,0,,,,,,,,
Level-3 datasets will be produced from these Level-2 datasets and be made available via the Data Portal.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, tools embedded within the Data Portal will permit easier ad hoc visualisation of the ATSR data by the users from these Level-3 datasets.",,0,,,,,,,,
For ATSR the Arc-Lake product offers an optimum solution for Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT).,,0,,,,,,,,
"Since this product is available at level-2, having been derived from the ATSR level-1b data at this pixel resolution, where available this product will supersede the level-2 retrievals described above for UOL_LST_2P.",,1,,,,,,,,
Arc-Lake is derived (where possible) from dual-view 3-channel retrievals for night-time and dual-view 2-channel retrievals for day-time.,,1,,,,,,,,
"For any lake pixels where Arc-Lake is not available, the UOL_LST_2P retrievals for the inland water biome are to be used.",,1,,,,,,,,
The locations where Arc-Lake retrievals are derived are defined using the ARC-Lake land/water mask.,,1,,,,,,,,
The Arc-Lake dataset will continually be extended within the framework of the Globolakes Project for additional smaller lakes thus extending the LSWT data available.,,1,,,,,,,,
At each new LSWT release of GloboLakes the (A)ATSR GlobTemperature single-sensor dataset will be re-processed.,,1,,,,,,,,
For Level-3 products the (A)ATSR LSWT data will be combined into a single dataset before being averaged onto a regular grid to quantify retrieval uncertainty and apply retrieval methods to other sensors.,,0,,,,,,,,
ARC-Lake v2.0 data products are available from the Edinburgh DataShare repository [RD-34].,,0,,,,,,,,
"For IST, the latest developments at ULeic in (A)ATSR IST retrievals over land and sea will be exploited and will supersede the UOL_LST_2P LST data in the GlobTemperature product.",,1,,,,,,,,
This includes the application of alternative retrieval coefficients for sea-ice (this being classified as an additional biome) and the exploitation of additional auxiliary data for snow/ice masking.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The cloud masking over snow/ice GlobTemperature single-sensor (A)ATSR LST product will encompass the optimum solutions for LST, LSWT and IST covering all land, lake, and sea-ice domains.",,0,,,,,,,,
Unrestricted use for ArcLake data (part of contractor's background IP).,,0,,,,,,,,
The single-sensor Metop-AVHRR LST product in harmonised format will apply as a baseline the LSA SAF split-window algorithm for SEVIRI adapted for the AVHRR response functions.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Emissivity estimates will be based on the Vegetation Cover Method, as with SEVIRI, while the atmospheric correction is based on ECMWF hourly forecasts of total column water vapour.",,0,,,,,,,,
The LSA SAF processing chain is not yet GlobTemperature harmonised format for dissemination via the GlobTemperature Data Portal.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Near real time AVHRR/Metop level 1b data, i.e. geo-located radiances and respective navigation information, are available via EUMETCast (http://www.eumetsat.int/home/main/dataaccess/eumetcast/index.htm).",,0,,,,,,,,
Off line data are archived at EUMETSAT UMARF and at IPMA.,,0,,,,,,,,
In the case that the LSA SAF processing chain takes longer to commission than the expected then the option exists to process the GlobTemperature single-sensor Metop-AVHRR LST dataset on the UK CEMS facility exploiting the core processing nodes and the dedicated GlobTemperature workspace.,,1,,,,,,,,
The full Level-1b data are archived on the CEDA archive with direct read access from these core processing nodes.,,0,,,,,,,,
Level-3 datasets will be produced from these Level-2 datasets and be made available via the Data Portal permitting swift user specified visualisation through embedded tools.,,0,,,,,,,,
The derivation of the Level-3 products will follow the same mechanics as for (A)ATSR ensuring consistency across products in the GlobTemperature suite.,,0,,,,,,,,
Background Intellectual Property Rights are applicable.,,0,,,,,,,,
The LSA-002 product is considered “essential” in accordance with the WMO Resolution 40 (Cg-XII).,,0,,,,,,,,
"This means that access to these SAF products is granted to all users without a licence, without charge and (http://www.eumetsat.int/website/wcm/idc/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dDocName=PDF_LEG_DATA_ POLICY&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased&Rendition=Web.",,1,,,,,,,,
"For Metop-AVHRR IST, the Level-3 dataset derived by DMI [RD-59] will form a stand-alone IST dataset in harmonised format.",,0,,,,,,,,
This consists of daily or 12 hourly merged and interpolated fields of IST produced using an optimal interpolation scheme developed for SST.,,0,,,,,,,,
The algorithm uses spatially varying and empirically determined error covariances.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Associated with each of the grid points is an error estimate, based upon the availability of the data.",,0,,,,,,,,
The spatial resolution of the IST grid is 5 km and covering the Arctic Sea ice (Northward of 58° N).,,0,,,,,,,,
Metop/AVHRR IST observations can be used without restrictions.,,0,,,,,,,,
"DMI only have IPRs on the processing software that has been used to generate the data, but as long as they are not used for commercial purposes the data is available to the project without restriction.",,1,,,,,,,,
The SSM/I-derived LST for 2003 will be provided to the GlobTemperature project.,,0,,,,,,,,
The LST are calculated at the SSM/I overpassing times (close to 6am and 6pm).,,0,,,,,,,,
It has been thoroughly evaluated by comparison with infrared estimates and with in situ measurements.,,0,,,,,,,,
The data can be projected on another grid and a specific format if necessary.,,1,,,,,,,,
"The SSM/I brightness temperature source data are publicly available, with no restriction to their use.",,0,,,,,,,,
The resultant LST data will be produced exclusively for the GlobTemperature Project under the ESA defined conditions of use of the GlobTemperature output datasets.,,0,,,,,,,,
The initial neural network inversion [RD-37] requires a large range of ancillary observations that are difficult to collect on near-real time.,,1,,,,,,,,
"It was first developed to estimate the atmospheric parameters over land from microwave, and since the atmospheric signal is small as compared to the surface contribution caution was necessary.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Based on the experience we have now with the retrieval of land surface parameters from microwave, the algorithm is to be revisited, limiting the number of ancillary inputs while maintaining the LST accuracy.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Work from [RD-42] showed that simpler algorithms have some potential, even using a single frequency channel from SSM/I.",,0,,,,,,,,
"This algorithm has been shown to yield realistic estimates of LST, for a large range of surfaces.",,0,,,,,,,,
"It is based on the assumption that microwave surface emissivities are stable in space and time, and it shows limitations especially for surfaces with low emissivities.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Our objective within GlobTemperature is to develop a LST retrieval algorithm, easily and broadly applicable to past and current microwave imagers.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The algorithm will be based on measurements provided by microwave conical scanners, from 19 to 90 GHz.",,0,,,,,,,,
"It will possibly require pre-calculated atlases of land surface emissivities, at the same frequencies.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Within the framework of GlobTemperature, three-years of LST will be produced from AMSR-E observations (2008-2010), on an equal area grid of 0.25° at the equator, for clear and cloudy conditions, at the overpassing time of AMSR-E (1:30AM and 13:30 PM).",,0,,,,,,,,
"The results will be carefully compared to existing IR estimates under clear sky conditions, and to available in situ measurements.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The AMSR-E brightness temperature source data are publicly available, with no restriction to their use.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The single-sensor LST dataset from SEVIRI/MSG series, generated by the LSA SAF processing, will be provided via the GlobTemperature Data Portal in the harmonised format (Section 6.5.1).",,0,,,,,,,,
"SEVIRI LST is generated using a generalized split-window algorithm (Section 6.2) with explicit correction for surface emissivity based on the vegetation cover method [RD-47, RD-50].",,0,,,,,,,,
"The atmospheric correction takes into account the differential absorption in the two split-window channels, adjusted to the view angle and water vapour in the atmosphere (as provided by ECMWF hourly forecasts).",,0,,,,,,,,
The SEVIRI LST dataset is currently available from 2005 to present.,,0,,,,,,,,
The LSA SAF will re-process the full SEVIRI archive (2004 – to present) maintaining a fixed algorithm (corresponding to that currently in operations) and using level 1.5 SEVIRI data re-processed at EUMETSAT.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The harmonised format, in terms of additional mandatory variables, projection and metadata is user- driven following the User Requirements Survey.",,0,,,,,,,,
The original level-2 SEVIRI data generated within the LSA SAF will be re-written following the harmonised format.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, tools embedded within the Data Portal will permit easier ad hoc visualisation of the SEVIRI LST data by the users.",,0,,,,,,,,
"This means that access to these SAF products is granted to all users without a licence, without charge and (http://www.eumetsat.int/website/wcm/idc/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dDocName=PDF_LEG_DATA_ POLICY&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased&Rendition=Web).",,0,,,,,,,,
SEVIRI data in the GlobTemperature harmonised format will be provided at a temporal resolution of 1 hour or better (addresses requirements REQ-25-TR and REQ-26-TR).,,0,,,,,,,,
The operational MODIS LST products (MOD11 / MYD11) for Terra / Aqua respectively are available from the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) [RD-60].,,0,,,,,,,,
Many users are familiar with these operational products.,,0,,,,,,,,
In GlobTemperature the dissemination of this data is to be improved upon via direct dissemination of a “value-added” product (MOGSV / MYGSV).,,0,,,,,,,,
This will be an entirely new data product independent of the MOD11 / MYD11 data streams.,,0,,,,,,,,
A key feature of the product is the provision of a full uncertainty budget from first principles consistent with the approach for (A)ASTR.,,0,,,,,,,,
The operational Level-2 MODIS LST (MOD11_L2 / MYD11_L2) datafiles provide geolocation at tie-points every 5 pixels x 5 pixels.,,0,,,,,,,,
For users requiring 1 km swath data they currently have two choices available for geolocation: i) to interpolate between tie-points, ii) to extract full resolution information from the MOD03 / MYD03 products.,,0,,,,,,,
This situation can be improved upon in GlobTemperature with the provision of Level-2 data in harmonised format.,,0,,,,,,,,
Full resolution geolocation and satellite viewing angles will be extracted directly from the corresponding MOD03 / MYD03 products and output with LST data from the MOD11_L2 / MYD11_L2 products.,,0,,,,,,,,
"In order to deliver uncertainty information from first principles consistent with other GlobTemperature products, such as (A)ATSR, it is necessary to derive new LST data from Level-1b radiances (MOD021KM / MYD021KM).",,1,,,,,,,,
"This involves the generation of new coefficients for the chosen algorithm, in this case existing the split-window algorithm used operationally for MODIS.",,0,,,,,,,,
These new coefficients however enhance the retrieval across-track through increased classification into viewing angle and water vapour classes with subsequent bias-correction.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Emissivity information is acquired from the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS) and spatial / temporal interpolation of emissivity, water vapour, and retrieval coefficients is carried out.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The uncertainty information adheres to a 3- component model, which identifies: i) uncertainty from random effects; ii) uncertainty from locally correlated effects; and iii) uncertainty from large-scale systematic effects.",,0,,,,,,,,
"MODIS operational Level-3 products do not contain any information on uncertainty, nor do they contain Quality Control information on the full range of cloud detection flags (a notable absence is masking from thin cirrus).",,0,,,,,,,,
"Taking the GlobTemperature LST data in harmonised format this information is to be incorporated into the GlobTemperature MODIS Level-3 “value-added” products, allowing for easier inter-comparability with other GlobTemperature higher-level products.",,0,,,,,,,,
"MODIS data and products acquired through the LP DAAC have no restrictions on subsequent use, sale, or redistribution (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/modis_policies.",,0,,,,,,,,
Level-1 data will be acquired from http://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/MOLT/ (Terra) and http://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/MOLA/ (Aqua) for subsequent harmonisation in GlobTemperature format for dissemination.,,0,,,,,,,,
From 2014 onwards a new MODIS LST and Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) product (MOD21 / MYD21) retrieved up to four times per day will be available [RD-61].,,0,,,,,,,,
This product is being generated by international collaborators at NASA-JPL and applies a physics based approach originally designed for ASTER LST retrievals but adapted to MODIS data - the Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The method retrieves LST and LSE in MODIS bands 29, 31 and 32.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Currently, users will be directed to the development dataset available from the NASA-JPL site: http://emissivity.jpl.nasa.gov/mod21.",,0,,,,,,,,
An email contact address will be provided to allow users to contact the data providers directly for the most up-to-date information on the status of the product.,,0,,,,,,,,
In this phase of access a significant amount of MOD21 data will be processed for validation and testing purposes.,,0,,,,,,,,
Once MOD21 has been officially released then the GlobTemperature Data Portal will instead link to the LP DAAC https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/community_products_table site [RD-60].,,0,,,,,,,,
User exploitation is then to comply with the individual conditions of use regarding distribution and acknowledgement.,,0,,,,,,,,
A Web Page on the GlobTemperature Data Portal will provide accompanying details for the dataset (addresses requirement REQ-37-TR).,,0,,,,,,,,
Individual band data and the LST Environmental Data Record (EDR) product is available to be (http://www.class.ncdc.noaa.gov/saa/products/search?datatype_family=VIIRS) GlobTemperature Data Portal will provide a link to this external data centre.,,0,,,,,,,,

Off line data are archived at EUMETSAT UMARF and at NEODC.,,0,,,,,,,,
Level-2 LST from IASI will be generated utilising work carried out on radiance inter-calibration of AATSR and IASI.,,0,,,,,,,,
The spectral response functions (spectral filters) of the AATSR instrument for each of the 11 and 12µm channels can be used in conjunction with the IASI radiance spectra to create quasi-AATSR brightness temperatures for IASI.,,0,,,,,,,,
"This process uses the integral of the IASI data with each spectral response function, with use of spectral-filter integrated Planck functions to generate the equivalent brightness temperature values.",,0,,,,,,,,
IASI emissivities will be convolved to the AATSR spectral responses exploiting work being carried out at the Met Office on developing a global emissivity dataset from IASI, and the Generalised Split-Window (GSW) then applied to retrieve LST.,,0,,,,,,,
"The product will be output in harmonised format, with Level-3 averaged data additionally produced.",,0,,,,,,,,
EUMETSAT radiances are available from http://eoportal.eumetsat.int/.,,0,,,,,,,,

"The ATSR series is scheduled to continue with the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) - which is based on the principles of AATSR - on board the Sentinel satellites 3-A and 3-B which comprise an element of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) / Copernicus programme, which responds to the requirements for an operational and near-real-time monitoring of the Earth surface over a period of 15 to 20 years.",,0,,,,,,,,
These are currently projected for launch in early-2016 (3-A) and 18 months later (3-B).,,0,,,,,,,,
"SLSTR is designed to retrieve global sea-surface temperatures to an accuracy of better than 0.3 K and global land surface temperature to an accuracy of less than 1 K. Like AATSR a dual view capability is maintained with SLSTR - the nadir swath being 1420 km, and the backward view being 750 km.",,0,,,,,,,,
This will support a maximum revisit time of 4 days in dual view and 1 day in single view.,,0,,,,,,,,
There are nine spectral channels including two additional bands optimised for fire monitoring and improved cloud detection.,,0,,,,,,,,
The spatial resolution of SLSTR is 500m in the visible and shortwave infrared channels and 1 km in the thermal infrared channels.,,0,,,,,,,,
The baseline retrieval for the operational ESA SLSTR LST product (SL_2_LST) is that which is described for the UOL_LST_2P retrieval for AATSR (Section 4.2.1).,,0,,,,,,,,
In other words it consists of a split-window algorithm with classes of coefficients for each biome-diurnal (day/night) combination.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Providing Sentinel 3-A launches on schedule and depending on the length of the commissioning phase, then the single-sensor dataset will be added to the GlobTemperature suite in the agreed harmonised format.",,1,,,,,,,,
A further plan is review both the existing SL_L2_LST algorithm and any proposed synergy LST algorithms from the SEN4LST Project [RD-66].,,0,,,,,,,,
A trade-off analysis will be performed for these and other potential algorithms with the selected algorithm processed to a Prototype GlobTemperature SLSTR LST GlobTemperature LST data from Sentinel-3 via the framework of a CCN.,,0,,,,,,,,

"The first step is to produce a daily merged LEO infra-red data set without any gap filling, with correction factors derived.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The process is based on AATSR and MODIS data initially, with AATSR as the reference sensor for the system; AVHRR data will be added when available.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The second step is to use the daily merged infra-red LEO data to derive correction factors for the GEO sensors, in comparison to expectations from the validation and intercomparison, once microwave data is available.",,1,,,,,,,,
This can also be compared at this point for clear-sky data to achieve harmonisation of the sensors.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Once the GEO data are merged, LEO data and GEO data can be merged; in areas not covered by GEO observations the following stage of the merging process is based on LEO-only data.",,1,,,,,,,,

"As with all GlobTemperature output products, the merged products will be delivered according to the agreed GlobTemperature harmonised format (addresses requirement REQ-40-TR).",,0,,,,,,,,
"The exact specifications of the primary merged product will be iterated with the ILSTE-WG, and modified as a result of tests of the prototype.",,0,,,,,,,,
The first critical step then is to understand the differences between the individual instruments.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Both ATSR-2 and AATSR were both stable instruments; ATSR-1 was affected by elevated operating temperature, 3.7μm channel failure, plus elevated stratospheric aerosols following the Mount Pinatubo eruption.",,0,,,,,,,,
"For SST inter-satellite differences have been shown to be ~0.1 K. As for SST, adjusting the resultant LSTs will not determine the cause of inter-instrument bias; homogenisation is more effective for BTs.",,0,,,,,,,,
"For generation of retrieval coefficients one needs to account for (known) differences in satellite calibration, in terms of spectral response for example.",,0,,,,,,,,
Since the ATSR’s are well-calibrated instruments corrections derived from cross-calibration are to be applied to the simulations in the coefficient generation process.,,1,,,,,,,,
A statistical model of δLST will be generated from double differences (for example: (AATSRsim – AATSRobs) – (ATSR-2sim – ATSR2obs)) and applied so as to adjust to a common Local Equator Crossing Time (LECT).,,0,,,,,,,,
The most suitable reference site is identified as Lake Tahoe (Section 5.2.5) which has provided continuous high-quality measurements since 1999.,,0,,,,,,,,
"This activity will deliver long-term data record from an instrument series (addresses requirements REQ- definition exhibit low bias, high precision, and high stability (addresses requirements REQ-5-TR, REQ-6- TR and REQ-7-TR).",,0,,,,,,,,
The adoption of better cloud clearing detection as delivered through the CCRR will further enhance the quality of the LST data.,,0,,,,,,,,
"GT-TS-14: Develop Climate Data Record of over 10-years for (A)ATSR in harmonised format with low bias, high precision, and high stability.",,0,,,,,,,,
Currently LST is not classified by GCOS as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV), an objective of this deliverable is for LST to be re-assessed in the light of prospective advances in understanding.,,0,,,,,,,
The GlobTemperature Matchup Database (GT_MDB) encompasses datafiles for both in situ validation and multi-sensor intercomparisons.,,0,,,,,,,,
Their individual requirements mean datafiles generated within the GT_MDB follow set variants of a single harmonised format with common core features (Section 6.5.3).,,0,,,,,,,,
For in situ validation satellite data providers are to deliver gridded LST subsets in harmonised format centred on the validation station for comparison with the station measurements.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The size of these subsets are determined by the characterisation of the surface for each individual stations, and may range from 5 x 5 pixels up to 50 x 50 pixels to ensure a sufficient coverage to capture the variability of the land around the validation site.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The spatial resolution will be consistent with the equivalent GlobTemperature Level-2, Level-3 or -4 datasets in equal-angle grids.",,0,,,,,,,,
All orbits overpassing a given site will be extracted as subsets for matching in the GT_MDB.,,1,,,,,,,,
Similarly the validation scientist will deliver in situ measurements and thence datafiles of satellite matchups vs. in situ data in harmonised formats to the GT_MDB.,,0,,,,,,,,
For intercomparisons the common proposed spatial resolution for re-gridding is 0.05º x 0.05º (compatible with both the merged LST products and the CDR).,,0,,,,,,,,
For some intercomparisons though other resolutions may be required (as detailed in Section 5.3).,,0,,,,,,,,
Both the mechanisms of intercomparison and the parameters for subsequent analysis may influence the results.,,0,,,,,,,,
The differences between weighted polygon averages for example and nearest neighbour binning may be significant, as may the temporal matching – nearest observation within a given time thresholds verses temporal interpolation.,,0,,,,,,,
"Also one needs to identify the importance of analysis with respect to different parameters: viewing geometry, orography, emissivity, and land cover classification for example.",,0,,,,,,,,
It is therefore important that all intercomparisons are carried out under a common framework.,,1,,,,,,,,
The baseline protocol for the matchup process is described in Section 5.1.3.,,0,,,,,,,,
This will be updated as the different mechanisms are better understood.,,0,,,,,,,,
It is then critical that the protocol is adhered to so as to give confidence to the user that each GlobTemperature output product has undergone a standardised evaluation.,,1,,,,,,,,
"An agreed process for intercomparison is particularly important since such a process is to be carried out by different individuals within the GlobTemperature Project Team, and it is important that results are consistent and comparable.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Specifically, intercomparisons of satellite observations coincident with in situ validation sites are to be carried out by KIT under the framework of the Validation and Intercomparison Work Package; while global satellite vs. satellite intercomparisons to generate empirical corrections for developing the suite of Merged LST Products will be split between ULeic and IPMA.",,1,,,,,,,,
All Satellite vs. Satellite matchups will be provided in the harmonised format for inclusion in the GT_MDB.,,0,,,,,,,,
Once the protocol is finalised then the use of open source solutions for data extraction will also be considered (a recommended solution is GDAL (www.gdal.org)).,,1,,,,,,,,
Parallel comparisons will be carried out between the GT_MDB developed tools and GDAL for consistency.,,0,,,,,,,,
ACRI-ST have developed several generic tools based on GDAL libraries allowing the generation of maps from sensor data dedicated to the comparison of satellite sensors.,,1,,,,,,,,
Such a solution will support the user requirement for transparency in product evaluation (addresses requirements REQ-31-TR and REQ-39-TR).,,0,,,,,,,,
The project team will implement a processing chain to generate in near real time the merged LST products.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Being a demonstrational service, the LST merged product will be generated at IPMA’s operational chain, archived locally and made available via FTP and through the GlobTemperature portal.",,1,,,,,,,,
For the majority of observations the objective is to provide users with data within 24 hours of acquisition with the target being within 12 hours (addresses requirements REQ-12a-TR and REQ-13-TR), the maximum timeliness being 2 days.,,0,,,,,,,
"The merged LST product (GEO-only and later GEO+LEO) shall be available in the GlobTemperature harmonised format, disseminated together with an error budget estimated on a pixel- by-pixel basis.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The order of dataset dissemination is governed by the guaranteed access to source datasets and both the need, and the complexity, of performing the conversion of datasets at the local facilities of the partners.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, some staging of data is needed, and the solution to this has been built on the UK- CEMS facility with 20 Tb of dedicated storage on the “globtemperature” workspace and access to central processing facilities to simplify the development of output datasets through code and data sharing.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, while most data will be archived directly on the main GlobTemperature archive at ACRI-ST other data will be hosted on the CEDA archive or on the LandSAF archive with direct dissemination from these archives via the GlobTemperature Data Portal.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The LST, IST and LSWT products to be produced within the framework of GlobTemperature, or externally linked to via the GlobTemperature Data Portal are summarised in Table 11, with the strategy for archiving and dissemination described in Table 12.",,0,,,,,,,,
The validation and intercomparison protocols will link Task 4 of the Project with the ILSTE-WG and with the LST White Paper [AD-6].,,0,,,,,,,,
"The approach GlobTemperature will take is to follow, as a baseline, the LST Validation Protocol [RD-5] developed for the ESA Long-term Land Surface Temperature Validation Project (as applied in [RD-68]).",,0,,,,,,,,
This protocol is quickly gaining recognition within the LST community and has also been incorporated into the ESA Sentinel-3 Cal-Val Plan [RD-70] for LST Validation.,,0,,,,,,,,
There is a wide variety of approaches to LST validation.,,0,,,,,,,,
The different types of approaches are structured here within four different categories.,,0,,,,,,,,
This is the traditional and most conclusive approach to validating LST.,,0,,,,,,,,
It involves a direct comparison of satellite-derived LST with collocated and simultaneously acquired LST from ground-based radiometers.,,0,,,,,,,,
"It is often more intensive than other approaches as a result of finding suitable sites, operating validation stations and obtaining the required ancillary information from additional measurements.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The measurements must be continuous and frequent enough to allow a close temporal matching between satellite overpasses and in-situ data, i.e. in-situ data need to be available every 1-3 minutes, which will also allow daytime and night-time validation.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, ancillary data relating to the near surface atmosphere, e.g. air temperature and humidity, and land surface emissivity data should be collected.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Ideally, the validation site is to be uniform at scales of several kilometres and covers at least 3x3 satellite pixels.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Although cloud-free campaigns with low aerosol content provide “ideal” conditions, validation should also be performed under difficult conditions and the in-situ measurements have to be continuously available and represent the whole bandwidth of possible atmospheres.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The in-situ instruments, e.g. radiometers or FTIR spectrometers, should be calibrated to as near an accuracy of ±0.1 K as possible given the restrictions of the instrument and be traceable to a NIST blackbody.",,0,,,,,,,,
Measuring the down-welling sky radiance allows correcting for reflected radiance contained in the radiance measured over the target.,,1,,,,,,,,
"In practise, this requires identical up-looking and down-looking sensors, e.g. as usually found in radiance balance sensors.",,0,,,,,,,,
In-situ emissivities need to be determined with appropriate spatial and temporal sampling to be representative of LSE.,,1,,,,,,,,
"However, in case of changes in surface moisture LSE may need to be retrieved several times per day.",,1,,,,,,,,
"In-situ measurements and laboratory measurements were performed for two of KIT’s validation sites [RD-74, RD-75], but generally such measurements are not available.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Depending on the surface type, the accuracy of in-situ LSE is usually between ±0.005 and ±0.015.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Where no in-situ emissivity data are available, the use of in-situ emissivities derived from MOD21 LSE is recommended.",,1,,,,,,,,
The fractional tree crown cover at the validation sites should be estimated and the emissivities of the relevant end-members should be acquired from literature.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The standard approach to obtain BBE is via regression relationships with multi-spectral emissivities, g. MODIS or ASTER LSE.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The regressions can directly be based on satellite emissivities [RD-76] or on spectral emissivities obtained from matching satellite-retrieved LSE with laboratory spectra [RD-77, RD-78].",,0,,,,,,,,
At night an upward viewing pyrgeometer can improve cloud-screening.,,1,,,,,,,,
"This technique uses top-of-atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperatures (BTs), LSE data, and atmospheric profiles of air temperature & water vapour content in conjunction with a radiative transfer model to simulate ground LST.",,0,,,,,,,,
Radiance-based validation offers a useful alternative to validation with in situ LST as it does not require in-situ measurements concurrent with the satellite overpass [RD-67].,,1,,,,,,,,
"The technique starts with an initial input satellite-retrieved LST value for which it simulates TOA BTs with a radiative transfer model; as inputs the model requires the - assumed to be known – LSE and (nearly) concurrent atmospheric profiles of air temperature, water vapour, and - if available - aerosols.",,1,,,,,,,,
Perturbations are then applied to the input LST value until the simulated TOA BTs bracket the BT observed by the satellite: the R-based LST (LSTR) is determined by interpolating between the bracketing LST.,,1,,,,,,,,
"The difference, δLST, between the initial input LST and LSTR is the LST uncertainty.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Radiance-based validation requires accurate knowledge about the vertical structure of the atmosphere, in particular about the vertical profiles of air temperature and water vapour, and LSE has to be known.",,1,,,,,,,,
"For selecting locations where R-based validation is to be carried out, a key criterion is the spatial homogeneity and temporal stability of the surface in terms of emissivity.",,1,,,,,,,,
"As for the atmospheric profiles, the most appropriate data for global analyses of LST products are outputs from global circulation models (GCM), in particular from atmospheric reanalyses interpolated to the time of the satellite observation.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, vertical profiles of air temperature and water vapour should be obtained from GCMs within a specified time around the satellite measurements and within a specified radius of the target area.",,1,,,,,,,,
"To assess whether the atmospheric profiles used in the radiative transfer simulations sufficiently represent the true atmospheric conditions observed during satellite retrievals the discrepancy δ(T11 – T12), which is the difference between the observed BT difference (T11 – T12)obs and the simulated BT difference (T11 – T12)sim, can be examined.",,0,,,,,,,,
"When the result of this ‘double-differencing test’, which was first implemented by [RD-67], is close to zero, then the atmospheric profiles can be assumed to be representative of the real conditions.",,1,,,,,,,,
"However, the accuracy of radiance-based validation still crucially depends on the accuracy of the input LSE, which must be known.",,1,,,,,,,,
A wide variety of airborne and space borne instruments collect thermal infrared data and many provide operational LST products.,,0,,,,,,,,
An inter-comparison of LST products from different satellite instruments is highly valuable for assessing relative algorithm performance and supplements in-situ and radiance- based validation by providing important information about the spatial distribution of LST deviations.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Intercomparisons facilitate the evaluation of the LST products relative consistency, which is highly important for users needing to judge the relative merit of several products.",,1,,,,,,,,
Intercomparisons are also mandatory when combining several products into a ‘best available product’.,,1,,,,,,,,
"However, product intercomparisons on their own are not sufficient for comprehensive validation since the various products could be ‘consistent’ but nonetheless biased with respect to reference data, i.e. in-situ LST.",,1,,,,,,,,
"This is achieved by re-gridding the data onto a common spatial grid by averaging all geo-referenced, cloud free pixels weighted by their respective fractional area overlap with the corresponding common grid cell.",,1,,,,,,,,
The high temporal variability of LST ensures that intercomparison of different LST products is a challenging prospect.,,1,,,,,,,,
"In order to minimise the impact on the intercomparison results, LST differences due to deviating observation times have to be minimised.",,1,,,,,,,,
This can be achieved by limiting the data to close temporal matchups, or – for intercomparisons between LEO and GEO datasets - by interpolating the GEO measurements that temporally bracket the LEO overpass time.,,1,,,,,,,
Analysing time series of satellite data over temporally stable targets allows identification of potential calibration drift or other issues with the instrument or the input data that manifest themselves over time.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, problems associated with cloud contamination may be identified from artefacts evident in the time series.",,0,,,,,,,,
Care must be taken in distinguishing between instrument-related issues such as calibration drift and real geophysical changes of the target site or the atmosphere.,,0,,,,,,,,
Time series provided at small spatial scales are subject to less spatial averaging and therefore provide more specific information with respect to temporal validation than time series of a merged global product.,,1,,,,,,,,
"While the latter is interesting independently, merged data sets tend to include a variety of instrumental issues and geophysical signals which are difficult to separate, and they are therefore less useful for validation purposes.",,1,,,,,,,,
A precision assessment reflects the repeatability of a product.,,0,,,,,,,,
This step is very important when analysing long time series or comparing different regions.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Ideally, such an assessment should be based on a comparison with reference (in-situ) data with well-defined small uncertainties.",,0,,,,,,,,
"However, due to the limited amount of such high quality reference data, precision is usually assessed by analysing the variability of LST products over surfaces known to be homogeneous and stable.",,1,,,,,,,,
"In case such surfaces are not available, e.g. if there is a heterogeneous and dynamic vegetation cover in the target area, precision may also be quantified by evaluating the ‘smoothness’ of the time series of some geostatistical metric, g. variograms generally show significant variability (nugget) for pixels separated by very short distances.",,1,,,,,,,,
The evaluation should also consider the frequency of valid data with additional details on data QA (such as the application of gap filling techniques).,,0,,,,,,,,
Histograms of the data can be used to check if the distributions are plausible.,,0,,,,,,,,
"It should be d that, while exhibiting certain similarities, these categories do not directly translate to the hierarchical validation classes as suggested previously for SST validation [RD-79] and by CEOS.",,1,,,,,,,,
"While a Category A validation will generally be more complex and resource-demanding than a Category D validation, the categories given here can be quite complementary and a comprehensive LST validation will ideally entail elements from all four of them.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Based on the complexity of the methodology and the expected accuracy of the validation, the four validation categories are further subdivided into several classes.",,1,,,,,,,,
For each category a set of quality criteria is established.,,0,,,,,,,,
A Class 1 validation must fulfil all these criteria.,,0,,,,,,,,
"For each subsequent class, one of the listed criteria can be relaxed.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, the LST uncertainties themselves need to be validated to provide further confidence to users of LST datasets.",,1,,,,,,,,
The protocol for this involves mapping the standard deviation of the satellite LST vs. in situ LST against the satellite uncertainty estimate and examining whether the uncertainty estimate falls within the predicted bounds (addresses requirement REQ-35-TR).,,0,,,,,,,,
"Only few active validation sites dedicated to long-term LST validation exist, namely KIT’s four validation sites in Portugal and Africa and the site operated by the University of Valencia in Spain [RD-23].",,0,,,,,,,,
"However, the latter operates on a campaign basis and usually provides some measurements during the summer months.",,1,,,,,,,,
"In order to increase the number of primary in-situ validation sites for the purpose of GlobTemperature, additional sites were selected based on a) their long-term operational availability and their category according to [RD-5].",,1,,,,,,,,
An overview of potentially useful validation sites is given in Table provide only a limited number of data points for past satellite sensor generations.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The ideal instrument for validating satellite-derived LST is a narrow band, narrow FOV radiometer with the same spectral characteristics and view direction as the overpassing satellite sensor.",,0,,,,,,,,
"In practise this is unfeasible, but many satellite sensors observe the surface close to nadir (or such measurements can be selected) and, therefore, can be validated with in-situ LST from well-chosen sufficiently isotropic sites, g. sites covered by grass or sand [RD-81, RD-82].",,1,,,,,,,,
"KIT’s validation stations and some ARM sites are equipped with narrowband infrared (IR) Heitronics KT-15 radiometers (self-calibrating, chopped radiometers, Heitronics Infrarot Messtechnik GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany).",,0,,,,,,,,
The KT-15 measures IR radiance between 9.6 and 11.5µm and expresses the results as BTs with an absolute accuracy of ±0.3 K over a wide temperature range [RD-83].,,0,,,,,,,,
"For radiometers measuring in the atmospheric window and for a small distance between the sensor and the surface (a few 10m), atmospheric attenuation of the surface-leaving IR radiance can be neglected.",,1,,,,,,,,
"However, the measurements contain radiance emitted by the surface (i.e. the target signal) as well as reflected downwelling TIR radiance originating from the atmosphere.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Where Tsfc is LST, ε is the channel-specific emissivity of the surface, B is the Planck function at the KT- with the KT-15’s response function [RD-18].",,1,,,,,,,,
"Depending on surface emissivity and on downwelling longwave radiance (e.g. a cold clear sky vs. a warm humid atmosphere), the reflection term in the above equation can cause differences of several degrees Celsius [RD-84].",,1,,,,,,,,
LST is obtained from KT-15 radiances by solving the above equation for B(Tsfc) and then solving the Planck function for Tsfc at the KT-15’s centre wavelength.,,1,,,,,,,,
SURFRAD [RD-85] and other stations provide upwelling and downwelling broadband hemispherical IR radiances which are related to BT via the Stefan–Boltzmann law.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Together with broadband emissivity (BBE), which can be obtained from regression relationships between BBE and MODIS multi-spectral LSE [RD-23, RD-76], LST can be obtained from the simplified radiative transfer equation at the land surface [RD-86, RD-87].",,0,,,,,,,,
"For meaningful comparisons with satellite-retrieved LST the land surface has to be near isotropic, since the in-situ sensors integrate over the entire lower hemisphere, whereas the satellite sensor is strongly directional (e.g. near nadir).",,1,,,,,,,,
"In order to avoid influence of the atmosphere on the broadband measurements (3-50µm), the distance between the in-situ sensor and the target has to be small, since the sensors also measure outside the atmospheric window.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Key sources for ground-based validation data will be KIT’s well established LST validation sites (Figure 7) in Evora (Portugal), Dahra (Senegal, subtropics), Gobabeb (Namibia, Namib desert) and at farms RMZ/Heimat (Namibia, Kalahari); according to the [RD-5] specifications, these are - for the solid land surface - currently the only available class A2 ground based validation stations worldwide.",,0,,,,,,,,
The core instruments of KIT’s validation stations are Heitronics KT-15.85 IIP infrared radiometers.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Relevant end-members are observed under a view angle of 30°; using this view angle instead of the nadir view is justified by the fact that the angular emissivity variation of sand, grass, and gravel is negligible up to view angles of at least 30° [RD-81, RD-82].",,0,,,,,,,,
From 25m height the KT-15’s full view angle of 8.5° results in a FOV of about 14 m2.,,0,,,,,,,,
"An additional KT-15 faces the sky at 53° with respect to zenith and measures the channel-specific downwelling longwave radiance, which is used to correct for the reflected component in the down-looking measurements.",,0,,,,,,,,
"In addition to the dedicated LST sites in Table 14, in-situ LST obtained from non-dedicated, continuously operating SURFRAD stations [RD-85] and ARM (Atmospheric Radiation Measurements) stations [RD-88] will be used for product validation within the GlobTemperature project (Figure 8).",,0,,,,,,,,
"SURFRAD stations were successfully utilised to validate MODIS LST [RD-76, RD-86] and GOES-R LST [RD-87, RD-89].",,0,,,,,,,,
In-situ LST from ARM sites were applied to validate AATSR LST [RD-16].,,0,,,,,,,,
The long-term maintenance of the SURFRAD stations (Table 15) and selected ARM stations (Table 16) ensures good opportunity for matchups of in-situ LST with satellite LST products.,,1,,,,,,,,
"The SURFRAD (Surface Radiation) network was established in 1993 through the support of NOAA's Office of Global Programs and has been operational since 1995 [RD-85, RD-87].",,0,,,,,,,,
"Its primary objective is to support climate research with accurate, continuous, long-term measurements pertaining to the surface radiation budget over the United States [RD-90].",,0,,,,,,,,
"Six of the seven SURFRAD sites were identified as useful for validating spatially moderate to coarse LST products [RD-86, RD-87]; the seventh site - Sioux Falls, SD – is to too heterogeneous in terms of land cover, making the in-situ measurements un- representative on the scale of the satellite pixel.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site SGP CF1 (Central Facility), Lamont, Oklahoma (http://www.arm.gov/sites/sgp/C), has been identified as the most appropriate ARM site for LST validation (Table 16).",,0,,,,,,,,
Thermometers (IRT) Wintronics (Heitronics KT15) and it is located in a large area with cattle pasture and wheat fields.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Due to the specific instrumentation at the sites, higher surface heterogeneity and/or small areas of the sites, many of the remaining ARM sites in Table 16 are less suitable for LST validation.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, the TWP sites are on the coast which complicates the validation of spatially coarse satellite LST.",,0,,,,,,,,
"GlobTemperature will focus on the ‘Southern Great Plains Facility’ SGP-CF1 site and then consider the NSA-sites, which in winter are covered by snow (Figure 9).",,0,,,,,,,,
"The Alfred-Wegener-Institute (Bremerhaven, Germany) has been operating the Georg-von-Neumayer- Station on Antarctica since 1981 (Neumayer I: 1981-1992, Neumayer II: 1992-2009, Neumayer III: 2009- now) (Figure 10 and Table 17).",,0,,,,,,,,
Neumayer’s meteorological observatory is designed as a radiation and climate monitoring station.,,0,,,,,,,,
Measurements of radiation are carried out on a large scale as part of a global observation network to detect long-term changes in the Earth's radiation budget and their impacts on climate.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Since 1998 derived surface temperatures at 1 min interval are available from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Bremen, Germany.",,0,,,,,,,,
"These are obtained from broadband hemispherical longwave fluxes (PIR and CGR4 pyrgeometers from Eppley and Kipp+Zonen), which are part of Neumayer’s Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) station.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The Lake Tahoe LST validation site (http://laketahoe.jpl.nasa.gov) is located at the border between California and Nevada (USA) and is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory [RD-91, RD-92] (Figure 11 and Table 18).",,0,,,,,,,,
"The site consists of four fixed buoys (TB1 - TB4) equipped with highly accurate, self-calibrating radiometers (7.8 µm - 13.6 µm) for measuring the lake’s skin temperature.",,0,,,,,,,,
The site has provided continuous data since 1999 at an interval of 2 minutes.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Measurements performed at the buoys are: upward and downward long wave radiation, upward and downward shortwave radiation, wind speed & direction, air pressure, air temperature, relative humidity, net radiation, aerosol optical depth, total column water vapour, skin temperature (from radiometer) and water temperature measured 1cm below the surface.",,0,,,,,,,,
Contact: Dr Simon J. Hook (Simon.J.Hook@jpl.nasa.gov).,,0,,,,,,,,
"The salinity of Salton Sea is approximately 45 g/l, thirty percent greater than that of the ocean [RD-93].",,0,,,,,,,,
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory operates a platform in the sea which provides the same set of parameters as the Lake Tahoe Site (http://saltonsea.jpl.nasa.gov).,,0,,,,,,,,
Data has been available since 2006 at an interval of 2 minutes.,,0,,,,,,,,
A summary of which datasets are to have intercomparison matchups extracted and a brief description of the matchup specifications are given in Table 20.,,0,,,,,,,,
Only feasible matchup combinations are listed, where the orbit characteristics of two sensors are not compatible for matching LST then no entry is made.,,1,,,,,,,
"Matchups are to be used both globally in the derivation of correction factors for the GEO/LEO merging, and within the framework of the Validation and Intercomparison activities centred on the validation sites.",,0,,,,,,,,
For matchups between datasets with different spatial resolutions or different orbital tracks the standard spatial resolution for re-gridding is proposed as being 0.05º x 0.05º.,,1,,,,,,,,
"As for temporal matching, for the most part the nearest temporal matchup – within a predefined project-wide threshold (7.5 minutes, which is half the temporal difference between temporally adjacent SEVIRI observations) – will be used.",,0,,,,,,,,
For matchups between LEO and GEO satellites where the temporal frequency of the GEO observations are high the possibility of interpolating between bracketing GEO observations to the LEO overpass time may provide more representative matchups, only data from SEVIRI offers such potential.,,1,,,,,,,
"For analysis of matchups specific auxiliary is recommended, such as viewing geometry, orography, emissivity, and land cover classification.",,0,,,,,,,,
Where available these should be supplied with the input satellite vs. satellite matchup datafiles (Section 6.5.3).,,1,,,,,,,,
These matchups provide the raw material for temporal / spatial compositing for delivery of user required intercomparison information via Data Portal visualisation tools (addresses requirement REQ-39-TR).,,0,,,,,,,,
This section sets out the scope of the GlobTemperature Products and their formats based on the inputs from the Requirements Baseline Document [AD-3].,,0,,,,,,,,
"The GlobTemperature website, available at http://www.globtemperature.info aims at providing information about the project.",,0,,,,,,,,
"In addition, the website also includes a restricted area dedicated to ESA and the partners of the project whose main objective is to share project documents.",,0,,,,,,,,
The web portal aims at providing access to the LST data and the associated documents and tools.,,0,,,,,,,,
It will be available on the sub-domain named “data” at http://data.globtemperature.info.,,0,,,,,,,,
"This portal must be an open system, easy to use and must be consistent with the users’ needs.",,0,,,,,,,,
"A catalogue of all the available data sets will be available online, presenting the main characteristics of the products.",,0,,,,,,,,
"For each data set, the user will be able to consult a detailed version of the metadata.",,1,,,,,,,,
"In particular, the access policy and the acknowledgements associated to the data set will be available on the interface.",,0,,,,,,,,
This kind of information must be given by the provider of the data set when it is included in the GlobTemperature Archive of the data portal (information often included in the header of the products).,,1,,,,,,,,
"It will be complemented with other useful information concerning the data sets, such as links to other websites, validation information or external online documents (addresses requirements REQ-19-TR, REQ-20-TR and REQ-38-TR).",,0,,,,,,,,
A registration procedure must be followed through a web form in order to gain access to project information and datasets.,,1,,,,,,,,
A procedure will also be developed to allow the user to enter a new password in case of password lost (Figure 15).,,0,,,,,,,,
The global GlobTemperature database will be separated in to parts (two different schemas in PostgreSQL).,,0,,,,,,,,
The first will be dedicated to the data themselves.,,0,,,,,,,,
It will host the metadata at the dataset level and at the product level.,,0,,,,,,,,
"In particular, the logical structure of the GlobTemperature archive (location of the products on disk) is stored in this database.",,0,,,,,,,,
The second will be dedicated to the management of users (information on registration) and requests (parameters of the request).,,0,,,,,,,,
"For each order, the link between the registered user and the associated order will be stored in the database.",,1,,,,,,,,
The schematic of the architecture is shown in Figure 18.,,0,,,,,,,,
"In this schematic, a user accesses the system through a DATA Interface.",,0,,,,,,,,
"This interface, representing the front-end, includes a form with all the parameters necessary to send a request to the system.",,0,,,,,,,,
This request is then processed on the back-end by the DATA management system.,,0,,,,,,,,
This component has a direct access to the data sets (physical on the local storage area or virtual in the case of external storage).,,1,,,,,,,,
It is also in charge of the I/O actions on the User & Request database and on the product database.,,0,,,,,,,,
"In response to the order received, the data is transferred from the archive to the Download area.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The DATA management system also controls the access to the metadata, stored in the product database, from the DATA Interface.",,0,,,,,,,,
The “Search” action generates a list of products corresponding to the criteria.,,0,,,,,,,,
This interface will contain a form with the parameters needed to request products.,,0,,,,,,,,
The list of parameters will be modified and completed during the project to be in accordance with the users ’needs and the characteristics of the datasets.,,0,,,,,,,,
This though would not be suitable for downloading large quantities of products depending of the browser used.,,0,,,,,,,,
"For the latter two options, bulk orders could be downloaded as one request.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Other solutions will be introduced depending on the user’s need, particularly in the case of non- interactive mode, which is a good way to include automated actions in scripts.",,1,,,,,,,,
These could include transfer of data products onto portable media provided by the user.,,0,,,,,,,,
A script will be set up on the dissemination system to automatically delete any ordered products older than 15 days.,,1,,,,,,,,
Extraction functionality can be added to the data portal.,,0,,,,,,,,
It is a useful tool in the context of a dissemination system because users may work on a region of interest (ROI).,,1,,,,,,,,
"In such a case, the specification of the coordinates can be done at the level of the interface and the extraction can be processed on the server side, before download.",,1,,,,,,,,
"This kind of tool is included in the Hermes service, dedicated to the dissemination of level-3 ocean color data (GlobColour products).",,0,,,,,,,,
A screenshot of the service is shown in (Figure 24) (new version will be online soon).,,0,,,,,,,,
The current version can be viewed at the http://hermes.acri.fr.,,0,,,,,,,,
"On this interface, the coordinates of the ROI can be directly inserted in the form (North, South, East, West fields) or can be selected using an interactive mode (by drawing a rectangular area in a web mapping environment).",,0,,,,,,,,
One can note that a module of quicklook visualization is also provided on the Hermes interface (Figure percentage of validated pixels in a product.,,0,,,,,,,,
Analysis tools will be provided on the data portal.,,0,,,,,,,,
Graphs and maps showing various statistics and comparisons on the LST data sets will be available online.,,0,,,,,,,,
These plots will be self-explanatory, they will include a legend and an acknowledgement to the data sources.,,1,,,,,,,
Detailed specifications will be appended in further versions in response to the users need and to recommendations of the International LST & E Working Group.,,0,,,,,,,,
This section will provide access to projection and conversion tools.,,0,,,,,,,,
A particularly useful tool is for all users to be able to read GlobTemperature data with minimal effort.,,0,,,,,,,,
Thus a tool for reading the harmonized formats described in Section 6.5 would be beneficial.,,1,,,,,,,,
"This requires any tool to be platform independent, with functionality for extracting subsets of data from the downloaded datafiles.",,1,,,,,,,,
Additional detailed specifications will be appended in further versions in response to the users need and to recommendations of the International LST & E Working Group.,,1,,,,,,,,
"The most commonly currently used tools are for data reading/sub-setting, data visualisation, data processing and data analysis, developed either internally or made available by external providers.",,0,,,,,,,,
Many such tools already exist and are exploited by many users of LST data.,,0,,,,,,,,
"As such, an optimum approach would be to allow users to share such tools, with GlobTemperature providing the facility to do this.",,0,,,,,,,,
There are expected to be reservations in ensuring that the shared tools are error free, while some LST data users are likely to be unable to share tools due to copyright issues.,,1,,,,,,,
"Thus, to meet this need within the user community a tool repository area on the GlobTemperature Data Portal will be set up whereby users will be able to upload tools they are willing to share (addresses requirement REQ-42-TR).",,1,,,,,,,,
"While some basic tests can be carried out on the uploaded tools to detect viruses for example, responsibility for the integrity, security and licensing implications must reside with the user who uploaded the tool.",,1,,,,,,,,
The user would also be responsible for providing the necessary information to install and exploit the tool.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, since many of these tools are likely to be written in a multitude of computer languages and delivered as a “black box” GlobTemperature is not able to support ongoing maintenance of such a suite of tools.",,0,,,,,,,,
Any bugs would be reported to the user who uploaded the tool – whether they then are in a position to deliver a fix is outside the influence of the Project.,,0,,,,,,,,
"A further tool, in high demand within the LST user community is the ability to screen data for cloud prior to downloading it.",,0,,,,,,,,
The presence of the cloud bits within the QC flags enable easy filtering of cloud from the delivered data.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, this tool will be designed to operate as a function of selected cloud cover fraction for the area of interest to be downloaded.",,0,,,,,,,,
The cloud-screening algorithm applied is to be documented (addresses requirement REQ-43-TR).,,0,,,,,,,,
Cloud filtering will also be applied within the proposed time series extraction tool.,,0,,,,,,,,
"This time series extraction tool will be able to cover an entire instrument mission, although it is initially proposed to operate on single grid-cell given the huge overhead of extracting and processing datafiles for the entire archive.",,1,,,,,,,,
Output of the time series extraction will be both as a plot and a datafile (in .csv format) (addresses requirement REQ-39-TR).,,0,,,,,,,,
Both the standard ESA (A)ATSR LST algorithm (ESA_V3_algm) [RD-22] and the enhanced ULeic LST algorithm (UOL_LST_algm) for AATSR (UOL_LST_2P) and SLSTR (SL_2_LST) use a nadir-only split-window approach with classes of coefficients for each combination of biome-diurnal (day/night) condition.,,0,,,,,,,,
The fractional vegetation cover (f) and precipitable water (pw) are seasonally dependent whereas the biome (i) is invariant.,,0,,,,,,,,
The retrieval parameters d and m are empirically determined from validation and control the behaviour of the algorithm for each zenith viewing angle (θ) across the nadir swath.,,0,,,,,,,,
The parameter d resolves increases in atmospheric attenuation as the zenith viewing angle increases due to increased water vapour.,,1,,,,,,,,
"The parameter m is supported by previous studies [RD-23, RD-24] which suggest a non-linear dependence term on the BT difference T11 - T12 would elicit improvement in the accuracy of the LST retrievals.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The rationale here is that the BT difference increases with increasing atmospheric water vapour, since attenuation due to water vapour is greater at 12μm than at 11μm.",,1,,,,,,,,
The nature of the algorithm means that land surface emissivity is implicitly dealt with.,,0,,,,,,,,
For the ESA_V3_algm there are 13 land biome classes and one lake class [RD-94] at a spatial resolution of 0.5°.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Validation of the standard AATSR LST product (ESA_V2 following the 2nd ATSR re-processing) [RD-23, RD- exploits 1 km BTs from the ATSRs to derive LST whereas the auxiliary data is at the much coarser spatial resolution of 0.5o; this restricts the capability to make the necessary corrections for land surface emissivity and atmospheric effects.",,0,,,,,,,,
"These scale differences cause artefacts in the LST products which often appear as sharp, straight boundaries aligned with lines of latitude and longitude [RD-25].",,0,,,,,,,,
In some cases large biases and absent values in the retrieved data were attributed to inaccuracies in the auxiliary data, the conclusion being that the resolution of these auxiliary data are not fine enough for their intended purpose.,,0,,,,,,,
"The UOL_V3_algm incorporates higher resolution auxiliary data files (ADFs) [RD-16, RD-25].",,0,,,,,,,,
"In addition, the original Globcover bare soil class has been divided into six separate classes, taking the total number of land and inland water classes to classification system known as the ATSR LST Biome version-2 (ALB-2).",,0,,,,,,,,
Precipitable water is derived from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim reanalysis [RD-96].,,0,,,,,,,,
"Each auxiliary data file is derived from 6-hourly monthly climatology corresponding to the 4 synoptic times - 00UTC, 06UTC, 12UTC and 18UTC - covering the 10-year period complement the use of higher resolution auxiliary data in the retrieval of LST from the AATSR instrument.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Necessarily, this work has also established the requirement to optimise the parameterisation of the retrieval across the nadir swath.",,0,,,,,,,,
"For the generation of the retrieval coefficients for each biome–diurnal (day/night) combination vertical atmospheric profiles of temperature, ozone, and water vapour, surface and near-surface conditions and the surface emissivities are input, in addition to specifying the spectral response functions of the instrument, into a radiative transfer model in order to simulate TOA BTs.",,0,,,,,,,,
Retrieval coefficients are determined by minimizing the l2-norm of the model fitting error (ΔLST).,,0,,,,,,,,
These algorithms do not take advantage of the dual angle capability of AATSR.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The rationale being that the disadvantages, such as surface heterogeneity and non-simultaneity of the two views – significant over most land surfaces – outweigh any potential benefits [RD-22].",,0,,,,,,,,
"Indeed, over homogeneous surfaces [RD-21] have illustrated that a dual angle algorithm may retrieve LST with more accuracy, but performance degrades as the surface becomes increasingly heterogeneous.",,1,,,,,,,,
The retrieval coefficients are determined by interpolation on a set of multi-dimensional look-up tables, these are obtained by linear regression of the simulation data generated by radiative transfer over a broad wide range of surface and atmospheric conditions.,,0,,,,,,,
"The look-up tables incorporate several improvements for the Split-Window LST algorithm such as view-angle dependence, water vapour dependence, and atmospheric lower boundary temperature dependence.",,0,,,,,,,,
"In addition, a physics-based day/night algorithm [RD-97] is employed to retrieve both surface spectral emissivity and temperature at 5 km resolution.",,1,,,,,,,,
"It achieves this by utilising seven MODIS TIR bands (20, rapidly than LSE.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The SW approach has high accuracy over graybody surfaces, but a lower accuracy over semi-arid regions.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The retrieval coefficients: 𝐴𝑗, 𝐵𝑗 (𝑗 = 1,2,3) and 𝐶 are dependent on water vapour and zenith view angle.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The algorithm is dependent on a linearization of the TOA BTs with the surface temperature and the controlling factors are the surface emissivity, atmosphere and satellite view-angle.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The coefficients are calculated using a regressive analysis technique, whereby simulated 𝑇10.8 and 𝑇12.0 are obtained from radiative transfer simulations performed over a wide variety of atmospheric profiles.",,0,,,,,,,,
"When compared with an independent dataset of radiative transfer simulations the algorithm and it’s coefficients were found to be bias free, although random errors tended to increase with increasing water vapour content and at high view-angles [RD-50].",,1,,,,,,,,
For the operational LST product the water vapour database used is that provided by ECMWF ERA-Interim.,,0,,,,,,,,
The channel surface emissivity is calculated from an average of bare-ground and fully vegetated emissivities weighted by the fractional vegetation cover (FV) and by the fraction of water within the pixel.,,0,,,,,,,,
"In a similar fashion to the AATSR algorithm, the emissivity extremes are selected from a look-up- table in accordance to the land cover classification.",,0,,,,,,,,
"In contrast, a new MODIS LST product (MOD21) being generated by international collaborators at NASA- JPL applies a physics based approach - the Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm, which was originally designed for ASTER LST retrievals, but has been adapted to MODIS data to retrieve LST and LSE in MODIS bands 29, 31 and 32 [RD-61].",,0,,,,,,,,
One rationale for this development is to improve on the retrieval in semi-arid regions.,,0,,,,,,,,
TES attempts to solve the ill-posed LST problem through the use of empirical methods to predict the minimum emissivity observed from a given spectral contrast.,,0,,,,,,,,
"This relationship is referred to as the TES calibration curve, and can be adjusted for any sensor's spectral response function in the TIR.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Although the AATSR instrument does not observe the surface with sufficient TIR channels to separate the LST and LSE explicitly, it is still possible to consider retrieval algorithms with an explicit emissivity term.",,0,,,,,,,,
Much work has been carried out in the LST community on developing alternative algorithms for LST from (A)ATSR.,,0,,,,,,,,
These include most notably the candidate algorithms developed for the SEN4LST Project [RD-66] amongst others [RD-99].,,0,,,,,,,,
"Theory, is a technique developed to help solve problems which are either over- or under- constrained and there is some degree of uncertainty in the measurements or formulation.",,0,,,,,,,,
"It has proved to be of great use in Earth Observation, specifically in resolving multispectral measurements to give multi-level atmospheric profiles.",,0,,,,,,,,
"In comparison to SW techniques, OE methods ensure that more consideration of the true physics is considered.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Generally this ensures that the retrieved state is more likely to reproduce the observation vector when used as input in a forward model, hence provides more confidence in the result.",,1,,,,,,,,
"However, the cost is whether or not the extra computation required is operationally feasible in the context of a global dataset.",,0,,,,,,,,
SAF provide three 1D-Var packages: a Met Office version, an ECMWF version, and an SSMIS version.,,0,,,,,,
The Met Office 1D-Var package is a flexible stand-alone optimal estimation routine suitable for user adaptation [RD-100].,,0,,,,,,,,
It was initially designed with the primary purpose of retrieving water vapour profiles using data from the IASI and AIRS instruments in conjunction with the RTTOV forward model.,,0,,,,,,,,
It has been constructed such that it can be easily adapted to use a number of different radiative transfer models and satellite instruments [RD-101].,,0,,,,,,,,
"In this project, the single-sensor data sets disseminated via the Data Portal will continue to be produced largely with the existing algorithms because of the nature of operational systems.",,1,,,,,,,,
The innovation in understanding of algorithms will come in two ways.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Firstly, in the merging work, the effects of algorithm bias is to be examined more closely by analysing more than one instrument data set with the same algorithm.",,0,,,,,,,,
"This will provide information on which are the dominant sources of bias, which components are due to the algorithms, and which are due to “auxiliary” information, thus allowing a better understanding of the algorithms to develop.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Secondly, an algorithm trade-off is being carried out prior to the derivation of an (A)ATSR Climate Data Record.",,0,,,,,,,,
The results of this trade-off analysis will feed in to the algorithm trade-off and optimisation as part of the extension to SLSTR.,,0,,,,,,,,
A number of algorithms are being assessed as potential candidates for the development of the (A)ATSR Climate Data Record, with these also pertinent for the Multi-Sensor Merged LST Product.,,0,,,,,,,
The Prototype Sentinel-3 LST Product will use these as inputs but additionally may consider other alternatives not previously suitable.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The standard ESA ATSR LST algorithm (ESA_V3_algm) is not considered a potential candidate algorithm since studies [RD-16, RD-68] have illustrated the significant improvement in accuracy and precision of the UOL_V3_algm compared to the ESA_V3_algm.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Nevertheless, the ESA_V3 LST Product will still be utilised for comparison purposes.",,0,,,,,,,,
The comprehensive Climate Data Record Trade-off Analysis is being delivered as a separate report (LST CDR Algorithm Trade-Off Analysis (DEL-8)) [AD-5] and thus only summarised here.,,1,,,,,,,,
For global production of a CDR several techniques may be employed to decouple surface emissivity and surface temperature.,,1,,,,,,,,
"The most widely used are: the Day/Night method, which require acquisitions twice per day and assumes that day/night emissivity differences are negligible; the Temperature Independent Spectral Indices (TISI) method, which provides relative emissivity values; the Temperature and Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm, which requires multispectral thermal infrared data (TIR); and methods based on retrieval from vegetation indices, such as the NDVI THresholds Method (NDVITHM) [RD-102].",,1,,,,,,,,
The additional thermal infrared (TIR) channels of MODIS permit a choice of algorithms to be exploited.,,1,,,,,,,,
"For instruments without multispectral thermal infrared capabilities, such as (A)ATSR and AVHRR, we are primarily reduced to approaches based on vegetation indices or enhancements on this by incorporation of land cover classification.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Emissivity retrieval from vegetation indices is based on a simple approach between emissivity and Fractional Vegetation Cover (FV) constrained by reference values of vegetation and soil emissivities from laboratory measurement, such as the ASTER spectral library [RD-103].",,0,,,,,,,,
Land cover information can be also used to categorise these emissivity values by land cover types.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The final approach is to utilise a third-party emissivity product, such as the ASTER-GED or the CIMSS dataset.",,0,,,,,,,,
For the Prototype Sentinel-3 LST Product similar arguments are applicable as for the LST CDR Algorithm Trade-Off Analysis (DEL-8) [AD-5].,,1,,,,,,,,
"However, the SEN4LST Dual-Angle algorithm (S4L_DA_algm) is also a viable option since this is a single-sensor algorithm for an instrument with both nadir and oblique views.",,1,,,,,,,,
A full analysis of the candidate algorithms will be carried out within the Sentinel LST Product Development Plan (DEL-23) activity.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Finally, the optimal estimation / 1D-var approaches, which are a very different alternative to the coefficient based algorithms in that they provide fits to the observed radiances within the constraints of the system, may be considered during the merged LST NRT activities where climate accuracy and stability may be less important.",,1,,,,,,,,
Further information on these approaches is expected to come from the study on assimilation of LST into NWP models (Section 7.5).,,0,,,,,,,,
"The structure, format, and purpose of the ILSTE-WG has been developed as a joint effort between U. Leicester (representing the requirements of the GlobTemperature Project) but also IPMA (representing both GlobTemperature and EUMETSAT through the LSA SAF) and NASA-JPL.",,0,,,,,,,,
The aim being to create a truly international group dedicated to the development of products and exploitation by users of LST and LSE data with multi-agency support.,,0,,,,,,,,
This is particularly important in the post-GlobTemperature era where continuing development of this Group may be sustained by various inter-agency funding streams.,,1,,,,,,,,
"The ILSTE-WG Steering Committee has been set up with key personnel representing different agencies involved in the satellite-retrieval of LST and LSE: ESA, NASA, NOAA and EUMETSAT.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, in addition to the invitation pack sent out to prospective members of the ILSTE-WG a tailored presentation has also been compiled for NASA Headquarters in order to gain high level support for the Group.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Indeed, Simon Hook (ILSTE-WG Steering Committee member) and Jose Sobrino (ILSTE- WG general member) are leading the LST/Emissivity focus area within the LPV.",,0,,,,,,,,
"A consistent approach to data validation, in line with CEOS-LPV Best Practices has been proposed from the LST Validation Protocol of [RD-5] and which is utilised here (Section .",,0,,,,,,,,
"The ILSTE-WG will manage Technical Advisory Groups to support the development and use of satellite LST information, to promote scientific insight and innovation, to identify best-practices, and to facilitate the transfer of new science into user's applications.",,1,,,,,,,,
These groups will seek to develop partnerships with these identified international bodies.,,0,,,,,,,,
"A further key aspect of the ILSTE-WG is to provide an independent source of advice and appraisal, as requested, for related projects run by supporting agencies.",,0,,,,,,,,
In addition to the ESA DUE GlobTemperature Project another initial recognised project is the NASA MEaSUREs (Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments) for which key ILSTE-WG Steering Committee members are involved in.,,0,,,,,,,,
"An objective of this project, in terms of LST and LSE, is to merge MODIS and GEO data.",,0,,,,,,,,
Considerable prospects of cross-collaboration between projects are envisaged through the focal point of the ILSTE- WG.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Data sharing and dissemination to users is also an important goal of the ILSTE-WG, and through early negotiation with NASA-JPL agreement has been sought and given for the GlobTemperature Data Portal to externally link with their datasets – MOD21 (Section 4.2.6) and ASTER GED (Section 4.2.12).",,0,,,,,,,,
Strong links have been developed with the Sentinel-3 Validation Teams in the Land domain.,,0,,,,,,,,
This brings the benefit of community agreement to share both LST data and associated validation data.,,0,,,,,,,,
"For example, data collected by our international partners at NASA JPL are to be made available to both the Sentinel-3 LST Validation Team and GlobTemperature from the well calibrated and established validation sites at Lake Tahoe and Salton Sea.",,0,,,,,,,,
"This section describes the proposed harmonised format for all Level-2, -3 and -4 GlobTemperature data products.",,0,,,,,,,,
Database (GT_MDB) are also proposed to conform to a harmonised format (Table 26 and Table 29).,,0,,,,,,,,
Appendix C – Harmonised Format Examples provides example netCDF-4 outputs for selected example orbits.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Where available in the source data for a given data stream optional fields will be supplied as mandatory in the corresponding output product, albeit in accompanying auxiliary datafiles (addresses requirement REQ-33-TR).",,1,,,,,,,,
To meet the user needs of a harmonised format (REQ-16-33: Establish a single file specification covering all metadata requirements) a distinction needs to be made between the tier of data this refers to.,,1,,,,,,,,
"In other words, single-sensor level-2 swath datafiles are to conform to a one harmonised format – with respect to the variables, metadata, and filename conventions - and higher-level (single-sensor, and merged products) are to conform to a harmonised format more appropriate to gridded data.",,0,,,,,,,,
"While both formats are to be netCDF-4 with common CF-compliant metadata (addresses requirement REQ-34-TR) and the majority of variables to be common, several differences due to the individual requirements of swath / gridded datasets are necessary.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Data providers are tasked with ensuring their products meet CF compliance, and a CF compliance checker is available online at http://titania.badc.rl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cf- checker.pl for confirmation.",,0,,,,,,,,
"All output datasets will be delivered in consistent data format, with the objective to provide consistent standardised metadata across all LST products at both file and granule level and a common data format which is well established and internationally accepted by the user community.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The choice on datafile format has been driven by the User Requirements, with detailed specifications influenced by the success of the standard formats of GHRSST.",,0,,,,,,,,
"For example, the standard Level-3 resolution for single-sensor datasets, the merged LST products, and the (A)ATSR LST CDR has been chosen to be 0.05° equal-angle daily data (with day and night distinguished); experience from GHRSST and SST_CCI informs that this is optimal and allows aggregation to many of the coarser spatio-temporal scales.",,1,,,,,,,,
Section 6.5.5 also specifies additional possible spatial / temporal resolutions which could be available from the Data Portal given sufficient user demand following feedback from User Consultations.,,0,,,,,,,,
The final harmonised formats are necessarily subject to approval with ILSTE-WG.,,0,,,,,,,,
"To facilitate optimum user uptake of the GlobTemperature products in harmonised format a set of tools will be developed in Python, which is open-source and platform independent software for reading and sub-setting the datafiles created in the harmonised formats.",,1,,,,,,,,
Level-2 products can be defined as geophysical variables derived from Level-1b source data at approximately the same spatial resolution and location as the Level-1b data.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Generally the projection is in a satellite projection with geographic information, although for more obscure satellite projections data may be re-projected onto an equal-angle grid of equivalent geospatial resolution.",,0,,,,,,,,
These data form the fundamental basis for higher-level products (addresses requirement REQ-1-TR).,,0,,,,,,,,
It is acknowledged that although the size of each datafile will be less than 200 Mb (addresses requirement REQ-10-TR) many users may only be able to successfully exploit datafiles considerably smaller.,,0,,,,,,,,
"As such, the GlobTemperature single-sensor Level-2 harmonised format is proposed to only include essential variables as mandatory.",,0,,,,,,,,
This will ensure the minimum datafile size for a given sensor is not restrictive to wide user uptake.,,1,,,,,,,,
GT-TS-31: As default datafiles to be disseminated with mandatory variables only.,,0,,,,,,,,
Optional fields are proposed to be included in accompanying datafiles.,,0,,,,,,,,
Data Providers are to be tasked with providing all mandatory fields in their GlobTemperature primary LST datafiles (labelled LST).,,0,,,,,,,,
"For optional fields, where information is available for the given sensor then these are to be provided as mandatory fields in the accompanying auxiliary datafiles (labelled AUX).",,1,,,,,,,,
"As standard, the Level-2 datafiles disseminated to the users will contain all the mandatory fields from the primary (LST) datafiles.",,0,,,,,,,,
"For dissemination of auxiliary fields a proposed approach to be agreed with the ILSTE-WG following feedback obtained from the 2nd and 3rd User Consultation Meetings is to offer both dissemination of the full auxiliary (AUX) datafiles, and the addition of user selected fields to the primary (LST) datafiles including select meteorological data (addresses requirements REQ-8-TR, REQ-9- TR, REQ-29-TR and REQ-32-TR).",,0,,,,,,,,
Where emissivity data are explicit these can be provided in the AUX datafiles.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Nonetheless, the approach to deriving emissivity for any given algorithm will be described in the accompanying Product User Guide (PUG).",,,0,,,,,,,
"In addition to the provision of netCDF datafiles, the option of disseminated the LST field alone will also be provided by way of GIS-compatible GeoTIFF format.",,,0,,,,,,,
To achieve such user definition of output files the optimum solution is to utilise the open source netCDF Operator (NCO) tools (http://nco.sourceforge.net/).,,,0,,,,,,,
These allow single command-line manipulation of netCDF-4 datafiles including the extraction and concatenation of variables.,,,0,,,,,,,
"They allow preservation of metadata, chunking and compression options.",,,0,,,,,,,
"NetCDF-4 incorporates in-built compression, where it is recommended that all data providers supply their products with the highest level of compression available (level 9), and customise the chunking of data for optimal storage.",,,0,,,,,,,
"High compression will increase the time to write the files, whereas no impact can be detected on the subsequent reading of these files.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Thus users will not be affected by reading highly compressed datafiles, while benefitting from much reduced datafile sizes.",,,1,,,,,,,
Further necessary account is taken of file size in the scaling of variables.,,,0,,,,,,,
Where possible floats should be scaled (using the add_offset and scale_factor attributes) and stored as short integers (which is a very efficient way of compressing the data of individual variables).,,,0,,,,,,,
In GHRSST the geolocation in the L2P datafiles are stored as floats to 3 decimal places.,,,0,,,,,,,
For LST the proposal is that these are stored to 4 decimal places.,,,0,,,,,,,
Level-3 products can be defined as products on a defined spatial / temporal grid mapped from the Level- requirements for fields related to the sampling.,,,0,,,,,,,
Level-4 products can be defined as datasets created from lower level data from multiple data streams that may or may not be gap-filled (addresses requirement REQ-2-TR).,,,0,,,,,,,
These products will be disseminated in datafiles of 10° x 10° tiles to reduce the output size of individual datafiles (addresses requirements REQ-10-TR and REQ-44-TR).,,,0,,,,,,,
"As for the single-sensor Level-2 swath data format many users may only be able to successfully exploit datafiles up to a certain size, considerably smaller than the 200 Mb from REQ-10-TR.",,,0,,,,,,,
For higher spatial resolution global Level-3 (single-sensor averaged products) and Level-4 (multi-sensor merged products) size becomes a pertinent consideration.,,,0,,,,,,,
"As such, optional fields are proposed to be included in accompanying datafiles similar to the structure for the Level-2 products.",,,0,,,,,,,
This framework ensures all GlobTemperature higher level products are delivered in datafiles appropriate to the user community (addresses requirement REQ-10-TR).,,,0,,,,,,,
"All information, such as observation time, will be preserved from Level-2 products to higher-level products.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In addition, the number of pixels averaged and the number excluded due to cloud will also be provided.",,,0,,,,,,,
The dissemination of optional variable and the compression of variables is proposed as per described in section 6.5.1.,,,0,,,,,,,
Similar to the Level-2 and Level-3 format descriptions (Section 6.5.1 and Section 6.5.2 respectively) the datafiles have unique features in addition to the core requirements.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Thus, core variables will be included in each output type in harmonised format with common metadata across all types.",,,0,,,,,,,
Since matchup datafiles by design are gridded and localised the constraints of file size are not restrictive here.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Moreover, the GT_MDB contains datafiles that are also internal to the database but nevertheless require definition so each data provider is able to adhere to a single format to expedite optimal matchup processing.",,,0,,,,,,,
From the User Requirements REQ-39-TR requires tools for generation of match-up datasets and data inter-comparison tools.,,,0,,,,,,,
To facilitate these requirements internal datafiles in harmonised format independent of the data source are required.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Data Providers are to be tasked with providing all mandatory fields in their input satellite LST extractions over each validation site, and if exists accompanying optional fields.",,,1,,,,,,,
This facilitates optimum knowledge of the different characteristics of individual LST datasets for understanding accuracy and precision with respect to in situ reference measurements.,,,0,,,,,,,
"For any given site, the satellite input LST is to be provided on a fixed grid as designated by the validation scientist.",,,0,,,,,,,
"All mandatory fields are to be filled for each validation site, and if exists accompanying optional fields.",,,1,,,,,,,
This facilitates optimum knowledge of the site characteristics including instrument details for understanding accuracy and precision.,,,0,,,,,,,
Taking the inputs described in Table 26 and Table 27 matchups between the satellite LST and coincident in situ measurements can be derived.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Note that matchups between in situ and satellite data may not be at the same location; for example, at the Gobabeb station satellite LST are taken from a location on the homogeneous gravel plains about 10 km east of the station.",,,0,,,,,,,
For satellite vs. satellite intercomparison matchups the proposed harmonised format is described in information to the users on multi-sensor matchups.,,,0,,,,,,,
"For example, monthly composites can be derived based on the individual matchup data and stored on the Data Portal for visualisation tools to map intercomparisons over user-defined spatial and temporal extents.",,,0,,,,,,,
"To facilitate detailed analysis of the differences between satellite LST data from matchups in terms of orography or land cover for example, a static / semi-dynamic (yearly updated) datafile is to be available to maintain such global information (Table 30).",,,1,,,,,,,
GT_MDB input satellite LST format and the GT_MDB in situ measurements format.,,,0,,,,,,,
These will all be documented in the accompanying Product User Guide (PUG).,,,0,,,,,,,
It is also the intention to assign Quality Flags to the LST products at a per-pixel level similar to those used for SST in the GHRSST convention to enable users to be more informed when filtering data.,,,1,,,,,,,
This agreement for these Quality Flags needs to be made in consultation with the ILSTE-WG so as to set a community standard that can be adopted by other data providers.,,,1,,,,,,,
These may be for example individual detailed cloud or confidence flags carried forward from the Level-1b source data.,,,0,,,,,,,
They are to be described in the flag_meanings and flag_masks variable attributes.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The Global metadata describe the whole file with regard to general information about conventions, data producer, contact information etc.",,,0,,,,,,,
Examples for the information provided in each of the used attributes can be found in Appendix C – Harmonised Format Examples.,,,0,,,,,,,
Refers to the metadata convention used in the file.,,,0,,,,,,,
For the harmonised format the Climate and Forecasting (CF) metadata convention version number.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Provides the start time of the product; this relates to an orbit, start of a day or start of a month.",,,0,,,,,,,
Provides the start time of the total coverage of the data for the Product.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Provides the end time of the product; this relates to an orbit, end of a day or end of a month.",,,0,,,,,,,
Provides the end time of the total coverage of the data for the Product.,,,0,,,,,,,
Provides the northernmost geographical extent of the data in the datafile.,,,0,,,,,,,
Provides the southernmost geographical extent of the data in the datafile.,,,0,,,,,,,
Provides the easternmost geographical extent of the data in the datafile.,,,0,,,,,,,
Provides the westernmost geographical extent of the data in the datafile.,,,0,,,,,,,
Each individual variable in the GlobTemperature harmonised format has its own metadata.,,,0,,,,,,,
Text description of the units the data is stored in.,,,0,,,,,,,
Some variables contain additional metadata attributes that are only relevant for the specific variable (Table 34).,,,0,,,,,,,
Used for variables which describe a classification (eg: land flag meanings.,,,0,,,,,,,
For each GlobTemperature product the variables and metadata will be documented within the Product User Guide (PUG).,,,0,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, a recommended approach to utilisation of the individual variables will also be documented in the accompanying PUG (addresses requirement REQ-20-TR).",,,0,,,,,,,
For Level-3 single sensor datasets the proposed standard spatial resolution is 0.05° equal-angle and the temporal resolution daily, each average is resolved for day / night retrievals (addresses requirement REQ-24-TR).,,,0,,,,,,
For the Level-4 GlobTemperature merged LST product the proposed spatial / temporal resolutions are detailed in Section 4.2.12.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Datasets created within GlobTemperature specifically for the high latitudes, such as IST datasets will be provided in harmonised format in equal-area projection (addresses requirement REQ-23-TR).",,,0,,,,,,,
The file length is thus consistent between the different types of datafiles ensuring maximum ease of use for the users of harmonised format products.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Each User Case Study will be supported by firstly, a designated core partner most directly related to their interests in terms of science and data; and secondly, by University of Reading who will maintain an overview of progress and help each group benefit from interactions across the consortium.",,,0,,,,,,,
Following feedback and interactions from the 2nd User Consultation Meeting this section will be updated with a further release of the User Case Study Work Plans prior to their commencement when a more complete picture of the available GlobTemperature output datasets is known and hence the work to be carried out can thus be more accurately organised.,,,1,,,,,,,
These updated Work Plans will adhere to a common format to simplify management of the suite of User Case Studies.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In this User Case Study, we will explore the issues involved in using LST retrievals to augment information from meteorological stations with a view to understanding the problem at different space and time scales and identifying core issues for generating a seamless product that can be used across different space and time scales.",,,0,,,,,,,
"To do this, we will make use of state of the art understanding on the relationships between LST retrievals and air temperature measurements gained from the literature and other projects.",,,0,,,,,,,
"We expect this study to highlight the core issues and to inform our strategy for the exploitation of LST retrievals in our future high resolution products for climate services, amongst other applications.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Satellite observations of surface temperature represent area-averaged ‘skin’ temperatures (i.e. the temperature of the Earth’s surface) at scales of several tens of metres to kilometres, whereas meteorological stations record the ambient air temperature at a height of around 2m at a specific spatial point.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Climate studies have traditionally utilised the latter, usually in a gridded or interpolated form, but are geographically limited where the spatial density of stations is low.",,,0,,,,,,,
This issue is becoming increasingly apparent as users ask for data sets with higher spatial resolution and better geographical coverage.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Satellite data can be used to augment station data sets, providing detailed spatial pattern information for surface temperature, and observations where in situ stations are absent.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Surface temperatures from satellites may also be informative with respect to spatial and temporal discrepancies in the station records themselves, for example resolving a non-climatic temperature change that results from geographical relocation of a station.",,,0,,,,,,,
"However, before any synergistic use of these different data sets can be properly developed, work must first be carried out to understand the relationships between these observation types, which although physically related, are fundamentally different.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Moreover, the satellite data have a number of limitations that must be taken into consideration; for example, cloud contamination in infrared data, uncertainties in the temperature retrievals and geolocation.",,,0,,,,,,,
"There are a number of studies documented in the literature where near-surface air temperature is estimated from satellite observations and nearly all of these adopt a statistical empirical approach to predict air temperatures from observed satellite variables and auxiliary data sets [RD-105, RD-106, RD- Europe within the framework of the European Reanalysis and Observations for Monitoring (EURO4M) project (see http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/msg_tmaxmin/).",,,0,,,,,,,
"In particular, in coastal regions where the skin- air temperature relationship is particularly complex, the effects of satellite view angle, cloud contamination, and where spatial heterogeneity is high as a result of changing topography or land use.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In this user case study we will determine the effect of spatial and temporal resolution on the accuracy of relationships between the different temperature data sets, as estimated in other studies.",,,0,,,,,,,
"We will do this in selected regions where there is a high-density network of stations, for example in Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and parts of the US.",,,1,,,,,,,
"This will also allow us to determine the impact of varying in situ network density, by withholding station data, as well as the effect of the resolution on which information is aggregated and the resolution of the satellite retrievals.",,,0,,,,,,,
The work will make use of several of the satellite temperature products produced in GlobTemperature to fully understand the spatial aspects of the problem (e.g. ATSR vs SEVIRI vs station).,,,0,,,,,,,
Uncertainty information provided in the GlobTemperature products will also be considered in the analysis.,,,0,,,,,,,
This work will enable the identification of the core issues in combining satellite and station data for climate applications.,,,0,,,,,,,
"A report will be written detailing the work undertaken, describing the issues found, with recommendations for future work.",,,0,,,,,,,
This information will then also be included in a journal article for peer review presenting the user case study and discussing its implications.,,,0,,,,,,,
"LST is one of the key parameters controlling the surface heat fluxes, and a key input for some of these ET models.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Here we will demonstrate the production of LST-driven evapotranspiration (ET) by running the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model, [RD-111] with one of the GlobTemperature generated products (Merged GEO v0.5) over 3 regional sites representative of different biomes and climate conditions.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The produced ET will be evaluated with the available in situ measurements and the estimates from other ET methodologies produced by the WACMOS-ET project (http://wacmoset.estellus.eu/), being the objective of the evaluation to signal strength and limitations of using the GlobTemperature LST to derive an ET product, compared with the other existing approaches [RD-112].",,,0,,,,,,,
"The main result will be one year of daily GlobTemperature LST-driven ET produced over 3 regional sites spread over 3 different continents representing different land cover and climate conditions, together with an analysis of the quality of the produced ET by comparison with other estimates.",,,0,,,,,,,
"This analysis will drive discussions on the potential to produce LST-driven ET by SEBS-like methodologies, taking into account the characteristics of the GlobTemperature LST estimates and the ancillary inputs required to run the model.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Over Europe, an area in the Rietholzbach catchment in Switzerland, corresponds to a pre-alpine region, including a sub-catchment studied for more than 30 years, to try the ET estimation over a region with pasture and coniferous forest.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Over Africa, a region with a climate dominated by the West-African monsoon around one of the savannah mesoscale sites of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) Land Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (ALMIP-2, a GEWEX Global Land Atmosphere System Study (GLASS) initiative), to test the ET estimation over a grassland region.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Over North America, a cultivated area around the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains site is selected in North America, to have an example of ET estimation over agricultural fields.",,,0,,,,,,,
"This case study will result in an early application of the GlobTemperature product into the expanding field of estimating ET from satellite measurements, and links the GlobTemperature project with another ESA project, WACMOS-ET, which is currently investigating the potential to develop global long-term ET products that may exploit existing and coming European EO assets (e.g., Envisat AATSR, MERIS, and the coming Sentinel series).",,,0,,,,,,,
This proposal aims at improving the sea ice description in the model using the remote sensed sea ice/snow surface temperatures from GlobTemperature with additional Metop_A observations.,,,0,,,,,,,
This will be implemented by improving the surface boundary condition of the thermodynamic equation that is solved in the sea-ice model.,,,0,,,,,,,
"A pre-processing of the L2P sea and ice surface temperature observations from GlobTemperature will be performed, where the GlobTemperature products are blended with IST observations from Metop_A, to produce a year of daily level 4 SST + IST fields, suitable to be ingested into the HYCOM-CICE model.",,,1,,,,,,,
The one year with daily SST and IST level 4 fields will cover the area shown in Figure 26.,,,0,,,,,,,
The data set will be constructed within the user case study and delivered to the project afterwards.,,,0,,,,,,,
DMI has vertical temperature measurements derived from 8 ice mass balance buoys that were deployed in 2012.,,,1,,,,,,,
These measurements with a thermistor every 2 cm through the ice will be used as a validation tool of the simulations.,,,0,,,,,,,
The differences in the ice cover and ice volume between the two simulations will be analyzed and the sea-ice concentration will be compared to the remote sensed sea ice concentration.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In addition the sea-ice surface temperatures derived from buoys, remote sensing and atmospheric forcing will be discussed and a discussion of the effect of assimilating the IST product direct into the ocean/sea-ice model will be given as well.",,,0,,,,,,,
The results may also show spatial differences which highlights areas where the IST product is most useful.,,,0,,,,,,,
This will be combined into a scientific peer-reviewed article.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Ultimately, the assimilation of IST into the sea-ice model will reduce the error associated with the sea- ice thickness and the sea-ice cover in the operational forecasts, which is of obvious beneficial for commercial marine operators in the ice-covered seas.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The experiments will start from month 12, initiated at PM2 and be carried in phase 2 of the project.",,,0,,,,,,,
The ATSR IST observations from GlobTemperature and the 1 km IST observations from Metop_A will be ingested into the DMI L4 IST processing system.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Daily gap free fields of IST will be produced for a year, with auxiliary information on the daily variability, to optimize the ingestion of the IST field into the HYCOM-CICE model.",,,0,,,,,,,
The one year level 4 IST data will be validated against drifting buoy observations.,,,0,,,,,,,
The daily IST fields will be available in Netcdf format to other partners within the GlobTemperature project after generation.,,,1,,,,,,,
The IST observations will be assimilated into the operational Arctic model at DMI with a nudging scheme that corrects the incoming atmospheric heat flux as an additional term that converges the surface temperature of the ice/snow cover towards the observations.,,,0,,,,,,,
This will enter into the upper boundary conditions of the thermodynamic equation solved by the sea ice model.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The IST has a large diurnal variability that very likely exceeds the differences between observations and modeled IST, therefore and in addition to the daily observed IST maps from GlobTemperature the diurnal variations will be used to form a series of fields that includes these variations.",,,1,,,,,,,
"The coupled ocean and sea ice model is a slightly modified version of HYCOM (HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model) v2.2.55 [RD-113, RD-114] and CICE v4.0 (Community Ice COde) [RD-115, RD-116].",,,0,,,,,,,
"HYCOM explores a hybrid coordinate that is isopycnal in the open, stratified ocean, but smoothly reverts to a terrain-following coordinate in shallow coastal regions, and to z-level coordinates in the mixed layer and/or unstratified seas.",,,0,,,,,,,
"CICE applies an elastic-viscous-plastic (EVP) sea ice rheology [RD-116, RD-117] and includes a multi- category ice thickness distribution.",,,0,,,,,,,
The thermodynamics of CICE allows for a vertical temperature profile with a vertical resolution defined by the number of thermodynamic layers (currently 4).,,,0,,,,,,,
This profile will be compared to the measurements obtained by the drifter buoys.,,,0,,,,,,,
The difference in of the input (ice/snow surface temperature) will be evaluated both with regards to temporal and spatial differences.,,,0,,,,,,,
The total sea-ice covered area from the two simulations will be compared to the total sea ice cover derived from OSISAF.,,,0,,,,,,,
Due to the lack of remote sensed ice volume the sea ice volume will be compared to model results from modeled sea-ice volume found by PIOMAS [RD-118].,,,0,,,,,,,
The temperature profiles from the buoys and the two simulations will be calculated and the differences will be analyzed.,,,1,,,,,,,
"The recent retreating sea-ice cover has increased the commercial interest of these remote areas during the last decade due to potential new ship routes, increased tourist cruises and oil exploration.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Consequently, the need for trustworthy forecasts of atmospheric and oceanographic conditions is highly needed for safely marine operations in ice-covered seas.",,,1,,,,,,,
DMI is involved in many projects regarding ice management and marine safety in the Arctic.,,,0,,,,,,,
These uses will thus directly benefit from improvements in the performance of the ocean and sea ice models.,,,0,,,,,,,
Numerical weather prediction models (NWP) rely on observations for their data assimilation.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The amount of data in the Arctic is sparse, thus the observational control of the NWP models in Arctic is limited, which allows larger variations of the results and likely larger error bars when compared to other regions.",,,0,,,,,,,
Monitoring Soil Moisture (SM) is a key variable to determine the water fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere.,,,0,,,,,,,
Thermal Infra-Red (TIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Additionally, if multiple observations of the land surface are taken at different times throughout the day they can be related to the soil thermal inertia [RD-120] and consequently to SM [RD-121]; and 3) In the optical domain (350-2500 nm), an increase of SM produces an overall decrease in albedo [RD-122] and specific absorption features in the Short-Wave Infrared Region (SWIR) [RD-123].",,,0,,,,,,,
"Each of these spectral regions has its own advantages and disadvantages for mapping SM [RD-124, RD- (1 to 2 orders of magnitude) to be compared with sensors in the optical or thermal infrared domain, due to the lower emitted energy in this region.",,,0,,,,,,,
This is the case of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) (50 km) or the future Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) (9km) missions dedicated to monitor SM.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Regarding optical and TIR sensors, they are greatly affected by the atmosphere, but, on the positive side, they allow a higher spatial and/or temporal resolution.",,,0,,,,,,,
Different methods have been proposed in the literature to combine thermal information with visible and near infrared data in order to estimate the root-zone SM.,,,0,,,,,,,
"This is the case of the Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) [RD-126] based on the triangle method, since it delimitates empirically the triangle formed when plotting many different cases of the Land Surface Temperature (LST) versus a Vegetation Index (VI) [RD-126, RD-127, RD-128, RD-129, RD-130].",,,0,,,,,,,
The triangle method was first used by [RD-131] based on the different thermal properties of soil and vegetation: for equal weather forcing conditions soil and vegetation temperatures differ and this fact explains why the LST-VI scatter plot shows a typical triangular shape [RD-126].,,,0,,,,,,,
The different ranges of moisture availability and fractional vegetation cover within the LST-VI spatial window affects its shape [RD-127].,,,0,,,,,,,
The upper boundary is called “dry edge” that represents dry soils and stressed vegetation where evapotranspiration (ET) does not occur and hence surface temperature is maximum.,,,1,,,,,,,
The “wet edge” establishes the lower boundary that corresponds with wet soils and unstressed vegetation where ET occurs near its potential rate and thus surface temperature is minimum and close to the air temperature.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Between the two edges, all intermediate conditions occur, and all SM conditions can consequently be represented within the LST-VI triangle space.",,,0,,,,,,,
The dimensions of this spatial domain have to be large enough to collect a sufficient amount of LST-VI cases to adequately define the triangle shape, and 3) Factors like land cover type and topography should also be taken into account to ensure the applicability of the method [RD-133].,,,0,,,,,,
In this study case study we propose to produce long time series of TVDI using GlobTemperature datasets for SEVIRI (~4km) and AATSR (1km).,,,0,,,,,,,
"LST data from SEVIRI and AATSR, produced by GlobTemperature, will be used.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The area of interest will be West Africa (upper left coordinates 28.0°N, 27.0°W, lower right 3.0°N 26.0°E) as this area presents the optimal conditions for applying the triangle method.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Particularly interesting is the Sahel region with semi-arid environments, a big sensitivity to drought spells as well as the availability of in situ soil moisture data in several sites.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In addition, optical data for computing vegetation indices required in the triangle method will be acquired.",,,0,,,,,,,
"SEVIRI level 1.5 data (0.6, 0.8 and 1.6 µm) is systematically received at the UoC-EUMETCAST processing system.",,,0,,,,,,,
MERIS reduced resolution level 2 and AATSR data (1km) will be also acquired from the ESA’s MERCI online servers.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Finally SMOS reprocessed L2 SM will be downloaded from am EOLI- SA/Category 1 access, currently granted at U. Copenhagen.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In situ soil moisture data aimed for product validation will be utilized for currently operated sites in Senegal (U. Copenhagen), Namibia (KIT), and the AMMA supersites in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, the latest ones in collaboration with AGRHYMET thanks to a DANIDA (Denmark's development cooperation) funded project.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In a first step, from the 15 minute SEVIRI LST, we will estimate the daily thermal inertia at SEVIRI scale as the morning temperature rise (δTs), expressed as the slope of the linear regression of all cloud-free LST observations between 6 and 12 UTC [RD-135].",,,0,,,,,,,
"The use of morning temperature rise (δTs) offers some advantages compared to absolute LST measurements; it offers more information than does the single observation of LST, and is less susceptible to systematic retrieval errors as it is a relative value.",,,0,,,,,,,
Thermal inertia measures the resistance of a material to changes in temperature [RD-136].,,,0,,,,,,,
A dry soil will present a higher value of δTs than a dry soil [RD-137].,,,0,,,,,,,
"Finally, to ensure the quality of the δTs data, we will filter out the cases where the R2 of the linear fit of the temperature rise was lower than a given threshold.",,,0,,,,,,,
Both real-time and archived optical data (since 2006 onwards) is corrected from atmospheric and BRDF effects at the UoC-EUMETCAST processing system.,,,0,,,,,,,
"First, the 15-minute directional reflectances were atmospherically corrected using a modified version of the Simplified Method for Atmospheric Correction (SMAC) code [RD-139, RD-140].",,,0,,,,,,,
"As the atmospheric correction requires an estimate of the aerosol optical depth, water vapour, and ozone content, this information is fed into SMAC from the relevant MODIS atmosphere products on a daily basis (MOD08_D3/MYD08_D3).",,,0,,,,,,,
"Then, a semi-empirical Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model, inherited from the MODIS BRDF model [RD-141] is fitted using all daytime observations in a 4-days period [RD-142].",,,0,,,,,,,
Modelled BRDF reflectances at local solar noon and observed at nadir were considered the NBAR and from those NDVI and SIWSI [RD-143] will be computed.,,,0,,,,,,,
The Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) will be calculated from the thermal data and vegetation index data.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The extension of the scene to be applied will be based on the conditions required for this method: it has to be large enough to represent a wide range of different soil moisture and vegetation fraction conditions, while small enough to ensure atmospheric forcing homogeneity.",,,0,,,,,,,
Additional mask might be applied to guarantee that the method is applied to both a topographically homogeneous area and to surfaces of similar aerodynamic roughness.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Once the triangles are calculated, results will be checked to remove those dates where the LST-VI triangle is not properly defined.",,,1,,,,,,,
"The R2 value of the dry edge fitting, selecting only those dates where the triangles in which this value is higher than a certain threshold.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Based on [RD-134], the TVDI values from AATSR and SEVIRI will be used as proxy for soil evaporative efficiency (SEE) at high spatial resolution (1-4 km).",,,0,,,,,,,
"Where 𝑆𝑀ℎ𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑠 is the high-resolution (1-4 km) SM product, downscaled from the original SMOS data efficiency (SEE), 𝑆𝐸𝐸ℎ𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑠 is the estimated SEE at high-resolution data, based on the TVDI, and 〈𝑆𝐸𝐸ℎ𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑠〉40𝑘𝑚 is its aggregated value at the SMOS scale.",,,0,,,,,,,
The soil moisture data will be validated with in-situ measurements.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Firstly, spatio-temporal trends in TVDI values will be compared with soil moisture and rainfall data.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Secondly, the SMOS SM and its downscaled product will be also validated with soil moisture measurements.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Due to the linear downscaling approach, bias in SMOS SM will also be transferred to the downscaled product, nevertheless, it is expected a higher agreement of the downscaled SM than with the original SMOS resolution.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Finally, changes of soil moisture will be related to vegetation dynamics by trend analysis of vegetation indices (NDVI and SIWSI) and remotely sensed Leaf Area Index.",,,0,,,,,,,
The aim of this work package is to assess the impact of assimilation of land surface temperature (LST) retrievals from satellite observations within a land data assimilation scheme that is coupled to a numerical weather prediction model.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The assessment will include both the impact on variables at the land surface (such as soil moisture and soil temperature), but also the key atmospheric forecast variables such as near surface temperature.",,,0,,,,,,,
The anticipated outcome of this study will be an assessment of the quality of the LST observations from satellite through comparisons with in situ data and NWP forecasts of LST.,,,0,,,,,,,
Satellite LST observations will then be assimilated into the Met Office land data assimilation scheme and an assessment of the impact to both land surface analyses (soil moisture and temperature) and atmospheric forecasts will be made.,,,1,,,,,,,
Because of the recent improvements to both the modelling of the land surface and assimilation at the Met Office the source of the satellite data will need to be from a recent observing period.,,,1,,,,,,,
Consequently either the GlobTemperature near real time data will be used or Met Office derived LST observations from polar or geostationary platforms.,,,0,,,,,,,
It is anticipated that this work will be performed during 2015.,,,0,,,,,,,
Assessment of LST quality through comparisons with in situ and model forecasts.,,,0,,,,,,,
In situ data such as the radiometer at the Met Office Cardington site would be used and converted to an equivalent LST measurement.,,,0,,,,,,,
The GlobTemperature product will be validated against both the in situ data and against values of LST from the operational Met Office atmosphere model.,,,0,,,,,,,
The in situ data is a more accurate reference but the model data gives global coverage.,,,0,,,,,,,
The metrics examined will be standard error and bias.,,,0,,,,,,,
Adaption of existing current Met Office land DA scheme to ingest new satellite LST observations.,,,0,,,,,,,
This will include simple quality control informed from work package 1.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Work is needed to adapt the current software (in Fortran 2003) to ingest the GlobTemperature product, including mapping the product to forecast model gridpoints, thus ensuring uniform coverage.",,,1,,,,,,,
It is expected there will be significant biases between GlobTemperature and the model LST fields over some surface types (e.g. desert) and so bias correction is likely to be required.,,,0,,,,,,,
This might need to be a function of both season and time of day.,,,0,,,,,,,
CDF matching (cumulative distribution function) is the preferred option for calculating the biases.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Outcome: Working software to ingest GlobTemperature data, perform QC and bias correct, meeting Met Office quality Standards, ready for use in a full NWP impact study.",,,0,,,,,,,
Trials of assimilation of satellite LST within the Met Office Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) system.,,,0,,,,,,,
"A trial of the full NWP system of at least one month duration will be performed in which satellite derived LSTs are assimilated using the new software on top of observations, satellite derived soil moisture).",,,0,,,,,,,
The forecast lead time in this assessment will be from 1 to 5 days.,,,0,,,,,,,
Outcome: a comprehensive report examining the results of the assimilation trial.,,,0,,,,,,,
The outcome of this study will be an assessment of the impact of satellite LST within an NWP system and recommendations for the operational use of such data.,,,0,,,,,,,
At operational NWP centres the use of land measurements has focused up to now on soil moisture and this study will be an important step forward in the use of satellite derived data.,,,0,,,,,,,
The results found here will equally be applicable to reanalysis work and will help to inform use of satellite data in projects such as the EURO4M – EURRA reanalysis (of which the Met Office is a partner).,,,0,,,,,,,
"Dissemination plans are provided in Table 12, and access information is provided in Section 6.1.3.",,,0,,,,,,,
Once a dataset is released to the user community via the Data Portal evolution of the algorithm and further re-processing will be carefully managed.,,,1,,,,,,,
A minimum period of three months will be enforced between releases.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The demand for a re-processed release will be governed both by user feedback, including detailed application within the User Case Studies, and any issues as identified by the ongoing Validation and Intercomparison activities.",,,0,,,,,,,
In reality it is not foreseen that progressive releases of the same dataset will occur at such a high frequency as quarterly (addresses requirement REQ-14-TR).,,,0,,,,,,,
Users will be updated via email on release of new and re-processed datasets.,,,1,,,,,,,
For current satellite data sources the timeliness of new observations will be 7 days once the final version of the given dataset has been released to the Data Portal for user dissemination (see Table 37).,,,1,,,,,,,
It is the intention of the Project consortium to support the Data Portal post-project.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The nature of this support is maintenance of the Data Portal architecture and functionality, and provision of existing data products.",,,0,,,,,,,
"There is a strong user requirement to keep products current on the Data Portal and to add new products, which is beyond the current scope of the Project, but where feasible (further funding, follow-on work, or other projects allow for this) such products can be updated.",,,0,,,,,,,
Each version of the Technical Specifications will include a list of publications directly related to the work carried out under the framework of the GlobTemperature Project.,,,0,,,,,,,
It is expected that each User Case Study will generate publishable material in addition to an overall publication on the Project itself.,,,0,,,,,,,
Additional publications will also be encouraged, it is expected that each scientific Work Package in this project will produce at least one such publication.,,,0,,,,,,
The publication of results in international peer- reviewed journals will be the responsibility of the lead Project Partner for each activity.,,,0,,,,,,,
Each publication will explicitly acknowledge the support of the ESA DUE GlobTemperature project.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Specifically, detailed user input into the specifications of the GlobTemperature Products; user involvement in testing the data (particularly through both the User Case Studies, and the Champion User setup); and a core programme in building the LST community globally, involving both data producers and users, through association with the EarthTemp network and the GlobTemperature UCMs will achieve a coherence and openness in facilitating the use of satellite LST data.",,,0,,,,,,,
Provision of products which meet the needs of the user community is thus the very core of the GlobTemperature Project.,,,0,,,,,,,
"As evident in the Baseline Requirements Document users of LST data are from a broad spectrum of disciplines, and vary in their capacity both to identify and access available datasets and to handle varied data formats.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Guidance is frequently required by users of LST data about the suitability of different datasets for different applications, together with quantification as to why individual datasets differ amongst themselves.",,,0,,,,,,,
The agreed common nomenclature (Section 2.1) for uncertainty and accuracy needs to be disseminated to the users so they are able to compare different datasets with knowledge that these are consistent in their information.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The objective is to provide comprehensive user-friendly to support to the user community, and where necessary to educate the user community in the optimum exploitation of satellite LST / IST and LSWT products.",,,0,,,,,,,
"This will be achieved via a mixture of personal communication via email / phone, information provided via the Website, GlobTemperature Newsletters [AD-4], peer-reviewed publications, GlobTemperature reports for public dissemination, conference / workshop presentations, and UCMs.",,,0,,,,,,,
A schematic of the communication lines with the user community is shown in Figure 30.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The strategy for user support also includes a commitment to sustained operation of GlobTemperature from all consortium members beyond the lifetime of the project; and particularly, from ACRI-ST who host the Website and Data Portal, the University of Leicester who lead the project, and IPMA who operate the NRT LST services of the LandSAF for EUMETSAT.",,,0,,,,,,,
"GlobTemperature User Mailing List is constantly evolving and regular emails are sent out to the users informing them of upcoming events, GlobTemperature news, Website and Data Portal developments such as the availability datasets and their documentation, which is also supplemented for “Champion Users” with more personal email updates.",,,0,,,,,,,
"This intensive level of communication with the users will continue throughout the Project lifetime and beyond, where for example notification of the availability of new datasets / re-processing of existing datasets will be announced in a timely manner (addresses requirement REQ-15-TR).",,,0,,,,,,,
The full GlobTemperature User Mailing List is available to all Project Partners via the GlobTemperature Website.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Statistics on individual user exploitation of the datasets on the Data Portal will be maintained as will the User Registrations on the Website and Data Portal with additional information on other interactions logged in the mailing list, such as attendance at User Consultation Meetings, participation in the User Requirements Survey.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Such level of detail, whereby types of users are categorised, is required to enable a more tailored approach to interacting with the user community.",,,1,,,,,,,
These groups will seek to develop partnerships with international bodies identified above.,,,0,,,,,,,
The ILSTE-WG in particular will cement relationships with the external activities / agencies listed in Table fostering formal links with these entities.,,,0,,,,,,,
The ILSTE-WG will also be a key guiding hand facilitating improved communications with the LST data providers and the user community (Figure 31).,,,0,,,,,,,
Conferences and workshops are an important forum for dissemination of user information through presentations to a wider audience.,,,0,,,,,,,
A presentation pack is available on the GlobTemperature Website as a resource for Project Partners to utilise when preparing conference / workshop presentations.,,,0,,,,,,,
It is anticipated that each Work Package will result in at least one presentation at a conference.,,,0,,,,,,,
The User Requirements defined from the results of the User Survey have been augmented with updates following mini- questionnaires carried out during breakout sessions.,,,0,,,,,,,
The Technical Specification and User Requirements can be linked to relevant GlobTemperature Deliverables.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Internal management deliverables are not linked since they do not relate specifically to the enumerated User Requirements or Technical Specifications, but are listed for completeness.",,,0,,,,,,,
The Technical Specifications have been updated following mini-questionnaires carried out during breakout sessions thus satisfying the technical requirement GT-TS-4, these updates are in response to the updates to the User Requirements (Table 6).,,,0,,,,,,
The updates to the Technical Specifications are summarised in Table 44.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Develop Climate Data Record of 20-years for (A)ATSR in harmonised format with low bias, high precision, and high stability.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Data Portal to provide visualisation tools and statistics for LST data, LST anomalies, validation information and intercomparison data.",,,0,,,,,,,
Where possible a mechanism will be explored through the ILSTE-WG for data providers and users to share visualisation and analysis tools.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Develop platform independent tools for reading and sub-setting datasets provided in the harmonised formats, and cloud filtered time series extraction.",,,0,,,,,,,
Where possible a mechanism will be explored for data providers and users to share reading and sub-setting tools.,,,1,,,,,,,
"User functionality to be provided to allow selection of optional variables from auxiliary datafiles, and Data Portal tools to allow sub-setting of data.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In addition to updates to the Technical Specifications via the updates to the User Requirements following the UCMs, the project also captures the qualitative user feedback from these meetings.",,,0,,,,,,,
This feedback should influence future developments within the Project.,,,0,,,,,,,
"As such, a set of User Feedback specifications has been defined; with individual items addressed in the previous sections, and a summary presented in Table 45.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Not all user feedback falls within the current scope of the Project, such as: the need for high spatial resolution data for urban studies in particular, but also for ET applications; continued updating of data products with new observations; and the provision of multi-year SSM/I data.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Where these lie outside the scope of the project, they are nonetheless recorded in the GlobTemperature UCM Reports [AD-7], but not transformed into specifications.",,,1,,,,,,,
The International LST & E Working Group (ILSTE-WG) core membership can be categorised as Steering Committee membership (Table 46) or General membership (Table 47).,,,0,,,,,,,
It is envisaged that although initial membership has been with these individuals over the course of the Project (and beyond) membership will be more fluid with additional members becoming involved.,,,0,,,,,,,
The structure and function of the ILSTE-WG may also evolve over the course of the Project (and beyond).,,,0,,,,,,,
"Here we define six classes of in situ data, describing a wide range of possibilities with respect to the data quality and expected validation accuracy as well as complexity and expense of data acquisition.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In addition to proper instrumentation and calibration, a key element in defining the different levels was the availability of multi-year time series of radiometer data, since long and consistent time series are becoming increasingly valuable, not only for allowing a significantly increased number of satellite vs. in situ matchups for better statistical analysis, but also for better identification of instrumental issues such as drift.",,,1,,,,,,,
A class 1 in situ validation site completely fulfils all the criteria listed above.,,,0,,,,,,,
"At the time of writing no such sites exist, primarily due to the lack of a comprehensive and documented uncertainty budget at the currently existing Class 2 sites.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Class 2 in situ data are established long-term in situ validation sites, completely equipped with one or more highly accurate and calibrated radiometers, which provide continuous observations with no or only small data gaps.",,,0,,,,,,,
The sites are either completely homogeneous over an area of ideally 3 x 3 pixels or alternatively heterogeneous with well-documented and measured heterogeneity.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In addition to radiometers, these sites measure the standard meteorological parameters.",,,0,,,,,,,
All instrumentation and procedures must be well documented and the site description must be available to the LST research community.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The sites in this class only lack one of the criteria listed above, in most cases this is a comprehensive uncertainty budget.",,,0,,,,,,,
In situ validation sites that fail to meet two of the criteria listed above are considered Class 3 sites.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In addition to the lack of an uncertainty budget, such sites typically have long (multi-year) time series but are not continuous in the sense that measurements are only taken during certain times of the year.",,,0,,,,,,,
"At this site, LST measurements have been carried out with calibrated radiometers for several years, however the sampling was limited to the summer months of each year.",,,0,,,,,,,
In situ validation sites that fail to meet three of the criteria listed are considered Class 4 sites.,,,0,,,,,,,
"This includes stations that have potential as Class 2 (or even Class 1) stations, but that currently only have relatively short time series which may have substantial gaps due to instrument failure or cloud conditions.",,,0,,,,,,,
Furthermore this class contains station networks established for reasons other than LST validation as well as most validation campaigns that provide high-quality and reasonably well- documented data but only for a very short time period.,,,0,,,,,,,
Class 5 in situ sites violate four of the listed criteria.,,,0,,,,,,,
"An example of Class 5 in situ data includes measurements made by the United States Climate Reference Network (USCRN) (NOAA/NESDIS, 2007).",,,0,,,,,,,
This network provides continuous surface temperature data at 114 stations located within the continental United States and is planned to be operated for many decades in order to provide consistent datasets for climate research.,,,0,,,,,,,
"However, while the stations provide data on infrared ground surface temperature, the calibration level of the instruments and thus the data quality is currently unknown.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In addition, the data are currently only recorded at hourly intervals.",,,0,,,,,,,
Further research needs to be undertaken to determine the feasibility of using USCRN data for LST validation.,,,0,,,,,,,
"If the outcome of such an analysis is positive, it is likely that USCRN data can be classified in one of the higher classes in future.",,,1,,,,,,,
Class 6 in situ observations violate at least five of the listed criteria.,,,0,,,,,,,
"This lowest level of complexity and validation quality is generally provided by in situ measurements of LST proxies, such as air temperature.",,,0,,,,,,,
"It has been shown that the air temperature and ground surface temperature are almost the same during certain hours of the night and that air temperature can thus be used as a surrogate dataset to validate LST as a first approximation if the satellite overpass occurs temporally close to those times (Prata, 2003).",,,1,,,,,,,
"While this technique obviously only allows for rough comparisons, air temperature is ubiquitously observed at a large number of meteorological stations worldwide, so this class potentially includes a multitude of stations that can be used for providing general guidance on LST quality at a global scale.",,,0,,,,,,,
Such an approach has for example been used in Greenland [RD-166].,,,0,,,,,,,
The accuracy classes for this category are established based upon the expected accuracy of both the radiative transfer code and the atmospheric profiles.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Three classes have been defined, ranging from highest to lowest expected accuracy of the validation.",,,0,,,,,,,
"A Class 1 radiance-based validation fulfils both of the criteria listed above, i.e. it uses line-by-line radiative transfer code in conjunction with atmospheric profiles of air temperature and water vapour observed directly at the validation site during the time of the satellite overpass.",,,0,,,,,,,
The combination of a line-by-line radiative transfer code together with a radiosonde-based atmospheric profile provides the highest possible level of accuracy for this type of LST validation.,,,1,,,,,,,
A Class 2 radiance-based validation is performed very similar to a Class 1 radiance-based validation, however one of the two classification criteria is not met.,,,0,,,,,,
"Therefore, a Class 2 radiance-based validation uses either a band-transmission radiative transfer model in conjunction with radiosonde-based atmospheric profiles observed directly at the validation site during the time of the satellite overpass or a line-by-line radiative transfer model in conjunction with atmospheric profiles obtained from a less accurate source such as from a reanalysis dataset.",,,0,,,,,,,
A Class 3 radiance-based validation relaxes both of the classification criteria necessary for a Class 1 validation: It uses a broad-band radiative transfer model together with atmospheric profiles obtained from an atmospheric model.,,,0,,,,,,,
"As such, this validation class is expected to provide the lowest level of validation accuracy; however it is still a very valuable validation method when no ground LST measurements are available.",,,1,,,,,,,
Matchup times must be within a specified threshold – a recommendation being ±10 minutes.,,,0,,,,,,,
A Class 1 inter-comparison is considered the most accurate type of inter-comparison.,,,0,,,,,,,
Such an inter-comparison can for example be accomplished by using data from two instruments onboard of the same satellite platform or alternatively from similar instruments flying successively along a similar orbit (such as the A-Train group of satellites).,,,0,,,,,,,
A Class 2 inter-comparison relaxes one of the criteria established above.,,,0,,,,,,,
"As such, this accuracy class encompasses LST inter-comparisons of datasets that deviate in their respective matchup times by more than the recommended threshold.",,,1,,,,,,,
A special case of Class 2 inter-comparisons are airborne LST observations.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Aircraft equipped with radiometers are a powerful tool for validating both TOA radiances and LST derived from spaceborne instruments, as they provide much higher spatial detail than satellite data.",,,1,,,,,,,
They further allow detailed observations of the atmospheric conditions.,,,0,,,,,,,
The primary advantage of the airborne platform is that it allows coverage over a much larger area than could normally be achieved with field measurements and provides significantly more spatial detail than satellite observations can deliver.,,,0,,,,,,,
"However, it is a requirement that the instrument is well calibrated.",,,0,,,,,,,
Airborne TIR instruments are generally flown in dedicated validation campaigns and as such are specifically set up to match the satellite instrument to be validated in terms of overpass time and viewing angle.,,,0,,,,,,,
"However, due to the episodic nature of such campaigns and the resulting lack of operational availability, data acquired in airborne LST campaigns does not fulfil one of the criteria listed above and thus is classified as a Class 2 inter-comparison.",,,1,,,,,,,
"The third accuracy class within the inter-comparison category encompasses the inter-comparison of satellite-derived LST data with spatially distributed LST proxy data, such as reanalysis data as provided by the ECMWF [RD-96, RD-167] or NCEP [RD-168].",,,0,,,,,,,
"In contrast to the other three validation categories, no specific key criteria were defined for category D. While criteria such as the length of time series, the number and size of gaps in the time series, and the temporal sampling could be used to define classes, such requirements are highly dependent on the goal of the time series analysis and vary widely.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Instead, accuracy classes for this category were established simply based on the geographical scale over which the time series are computed.",,,0,,,,,,,
"This follows the idea that localized time series will be able to be interpreted more easily than global time series, as the latter usually combine a whole number of artificial and natural issues and thus make the identification of individual instrument problems or similar validation issues very challenging.",,,1,,,,,,,
A Class 1 time series analysis is performed at the single pixel level (or an average over a small number of neighbouring pixels).,,,0,,,,,,,
"Plotting and studying reasonably long time series of such a small area can be very valuable for identifying algorithm and instrument issues, such as increased noise or calibration drift.",,,0,,,,,,,
A Class 2 time series analysis is performed at for a geographically invariant scene.,,,0,,,,,,,
For most instruments on low earth orbit platforms this means areas at a scale on the order of a few hundred kilometres.,,,0,,,,,,,
A Class 3 time series analysis is performed at the regional scale.,,,0,,,,,,,
"This could be on the scale of a country, a continent, or a certain land cover type.",,,0,,,,,,,
"While not as powerful as Class 1 and 2, this type of time series analysis can still provide valuable information about problems in the data.",,,0,,,,,,,
For biome based retrieval algorithms this may uncover biome-specific retrieval issues.,,,0,,,,,,,
A Class 4 time series analysis is computed at the global scale.,,,0,,,,,,,
"While this type of analysis is not as useful for validation purposes as the other three classes, it can still provide interesting information.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, after establishing their accuracy, global time series are extremely relevant for global change research.",,,0,,,,,,,
"USGS/Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, South Dakota.",,,0,,,,,,,
"This is the SoA of devices and actuators technologies, capabilities, drawbacks, innovative approaches and challenges that are closely related to DiYSE.",,,0,,,,,,,

"The DiYSE project has three State of the Art (SOTA) documents covering the different tools, techniques, methods and environments that may be used to provide a DiYSE platform.",,,0,,,,,,,
These documents present the same pool of elements from different points of view.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Due to this SOTA partition, it will be needed to link some of the sections from one of the documents to other sections on some of the other two documents.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In WP1 (Use cases and requirements), deliverable D1.1 will focus on which requirements will be covered by web technologies, mobile technologies, system platforms and toolsets, i.e. how the users will access the smart experiences by using these systems.",,,0,,,,,,,
"This document will present the SOTA of current applications, systems platforms and business models relating to DiYSE.",,,0,,,,,,,
"This includes Ambient Experience applications, features of toolsets and the business models and ecosystems that are working at this moment in similar proposals.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The document also includes a PEST (Political, Economical, Social, Technological) analysis.",,,0,,,,,,,
"It is important to know why people are motivated to produce and share services, devices, etc.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In WP4 (Interactive Experience Creation), deliverable D4.1 analyses similar elements to D1.1, but from the user/developer point of view: how the users will use the elements of the DiYSE ecosystem.",,,0,,,,,,,
The review of existing application creation approaches will identify technologies that may be supportive for the envisioned creation of applications and services in smart spaces.,,,0,,,,,,,
Also the issue of actually do-it-yourself versus do-it-together (or have the community do it for you) and crowdsourcing will be addressed.,,,0,,,,,,,
The document reviews how to create interactive experiences.,,,0,,,,,,,
The objective of the whole Do-it-Yourself Smart Experiences (DiYSE) project is to enable people to transform their everyday environment into a highly personalized meaningful communication/interaction experience that can span the home and city domains.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The project aims to create a marketplace for user-generated application components, in which non-technically-skilled people can participate, re-using components designed by savvy users.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Within the DiYSE project, work package 2 aims at bridging the gap between software and the physical world.",,,0,,,,,,,
It will do so by enabling end users to connect to the system all kind of input and output devices and smart objects.,,,1,,,,,,,
"They will enable to gather raw data from the environment, process it and enrich it to deliver meaningful information about surrounding phenomena and more generally interact with the environment.",,,0,,,,,,,
Work package 2 has the challenge of enabling non-technical users to customize their environment by installing and configuring themselves devices they can buy or easily assemble.,,,0,,,,,,,
"We will produce software and documentation both for expert users wanting to assemble hardware and customize software to tailor it for their usage, and also for non-technical users wanting to reuse final hardware and software components.",,,0,,,,,,,
The objective of this document is to study the state of the art on several technical challenges in heterogeneous Internet-of-things device interconnection and derive high-level requirements for the architecture design phase.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Section 2 lays the context for non-technical users on the kind of devices we are addressing, the interactions they provide and the realistic scenarios where they can be used.",,,0,,,,,,,
Section 4 deals with techniques and algorithms to extract meaningful information (such as identification or location) from raw data provided by devices and the way this information is delivered to applications.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Section 5 zooms into a specific technology for the interaction with the environment, Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In particular, we will identify the potential and the major challenges raised by its use in DiYSE applications, and analyze the associated requirements and state-of-the-art.",,,0,,,,,,,
Section 6 provides a brief survey on the existing Do-it-Yourself hardware platforms and identifies the technical challenges that need to be addressed to simplify the exposure of DiY devices in the DiYSE platform.,,,0,,,,,,,
This section aims at providing partners that are not involved in WP2 with information about the devices that may be available to the project and the kind of general functionalities that those provide.,,,0,,,,,,,
"It will also identify a few representative scenarios involving devices, which will be used as guiding vectors for WP2 works.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Data acquisition (or sensing): device is used to capture data from the physical world (e.g. : acceleration, temperature…) and provide information to the system.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Identification: specific type of data acquisition providing the unique identity of an object (e.g. : using barcodes, smartcards, RFID tags, etc.",,,0,,,,,,,
Sensors can sample data periodically (eg: sound recording) or trigger events when a given condition is met.,,,1,,,,,,,
"For instance, IP cameras might be employed to read the lighting level, so that some component may ask “Is it dark?” and the reply would be true or false.",,,0,,,,,,,
"They can also be used to recognise some objects (i.e. : a game where a child has to find a picture hidden in a room, and then show it to the camera so it can continue to the next step) and they can record and or analyse sound upon request (for example, recognise when someone is crying).",,,0,,,,,,,
Some IP cameras have integrated speakers that can be used to play sounds (waveforms).,,,0,,,,,,,
These can be used to play a given sound when a certain message is received.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Finally, there are cameras with a small LED light that might be used to provide information to the user.",,,0,,,,,,,
There are several devices for locating and positioning people and objects.,,,0,,,,,,,
"For instance, mobile phones can be used for locating purposes and GSM / GPS devices can be used for locating people indoor and outdoor too.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In the later case, when GPS signal is lost, GSM and last GPS position are used to locate people, some commercial devices such as Navento [4] and Senda GPS [5] use this approach.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Smart phones supported with GPS, Bluetooth, digital compass and WIFI technology provide a variety of techniques to perform user location.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Laptops, netPCs may use WIFI connection to locate users.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In the other hand, there are other kinds of devices such as RFid tags and magnetic tags that can be applied for locating purposes.",,,0,,,,,,,
Finally QR-codes and others patterns can be also used to locate people and objects.,,,0,,,,,,,
"When the presence and identity of people and objects matters but their exact location does not, then the identification process appears.",,,1,,,,,,,
"There are a lot of devices and techniques in order to identify people and objects, the most frequently used being RFID tags.",,,0,,,,,,,
Each tag provides information about the object or people who carry it.,,,0,,,,,,,
Some examples of use can be found in parking or room access control systems.,,,0,,,,,,,
Another kind of identification system uses visual recognition of some patterns.,,,0,,,,,,,
QR-codes can be used to provide identification information too.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In the other hand, wireless connection devices can provide identification information via the communication technology they use, i.e., Bluetooth, Zigbee, and WLAN can provide MAC addresses in order to identify devices or people who carry or wear them.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Finally, smart and mobile phones can provide identification information depending on the cell they are connected at each time.",,,0,,,,,,,
This section lists the high-level requirements for the integration of devices in the DiYSE platform and identifies for each of them the existing standards and technologies.,,,0,,,,,,,
This subsection is devoted to overview the different communication technologies which could be used by devices in any of the proposed DiYSE scenarios.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Despite on those scenarios most communication technologies are hard-wired (due in part to the lack of appropriate, reliable, and cost-effective wireless solutions), in this subsection we will only focus on wireless alternatives.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The main advantages of a wireless solution are its ease of installation and deployment, the system flexibility, a dynamic network formation and the low cost which are mandatory issues for the proposed scenarios.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Moreover, this subsection finishes with a survey of the most commonly used approaches to provide the coexistence and the interoperability of the related standards1.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Generally Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are originally standalone networks, where sensor readings are usually disseminated towards the sinks or gateways located in the boundaries.",,,0,,,,,,,
"However, numerous WSN applications lead to the need of interconnecting WSNs to the external networks (e.g. Internet) to introduce WSN applications into different domains.",,,0,,,,,,,
The interconnection of WSNs with Internet or other communication networks also relaxes the control and management tasks of WSNs under dynamic changes of the application environment (see Section 3.8).,,,0,,,,,,,
"The IEEE 802.15.4 standard, designed specifically for remote monitoring and control applications, defines the characteristics of the physical and MAC layers for Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPAN).",,,0,,,,,,,
"Several leading radio manufacturers have implemented IEEE 802.15.4, which specifies a wireless link for low-power personal area networks.",,,0,,,,,,,
"It is widely used in embedded applications, such as environmental monitoring to improve agricultural yields, structural monitoring to track building and bridge integrity, industrial control to provide more sense points and control points at lower cost.",,,0,,,,,,,
"These applications generally require numerous low-cost nodes communicating over multiple hops to cover a large geographical area, and they must operate unattended for years on modest batteries.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Such requirements target a very different set of applications than do WPAN technologies such as Bluetooth, which eliminate wiring for headsets, game controllers, and personal devices.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Accordingly, 802.15.4’s capabilities are more limited than other WPANs and WLANs – they have small frame sizes, low bandwidth, and low transmit power.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Additionally, the microcontrollers typically coupled with LR- WPAN radios have limited memory and compute power.",,,0,,,,,,,
"This stack specification builds upon the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, hence it only defines the network and security layer, handling star and peer-to-peer network topologies, and providing a framework for application programming in the application layer.",,,0,,,,,,,
The 6LowPAN group has defined encapsulation and header compression mechanisms that allow IPv6 packets to be sent to and received from over IEEE 802.15.4 based networks [3].,,,0,,,,,,,
"Because of the potential of direct compatibility with the existing Internet infrastructure, 6LowPAN can be viewed as a significant factor in future sensor networks.",,,0,,,,,,,
It is also the most profound RFC [4] clearly breaking the OSI layered model and it exploits cross-layer information to minimise protocol overhead.,,,0,,,,,,,
It uses information in the link and adaptation layers to compress network- and transport-layer headers.,,,1,,,,,,,
The 6LowPAN may be connected to other IP networks through one or more border routers that forward IP datagrams between different media.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Connectivity to other IP networks may be provided through any arbitrary link, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, GPRS, or satellite as the next figure shows.",,,0,,,,,,,
"It is an open-standard wireless networking technology developed by HART organizing, and self-healing mesh architecture and it currently operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM Band upon IEEE 802.15.4 standard but specifying new Data-link (including MAC), Network, Transport, and Application layers.",,,0,,,,,,,
W-HART was defined specifically for the requirements of process field device networks and industrial automation and to interoperate with the widely existing HART technology [5].,,,0,,,,,,,
"It is a proprietary mesh network standard developed by ZenySys and standardized by the Z-Wave alliance (including Intel and Cisco) which is intended for home automation, residential and light commercial environments.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Some of its applications embedded in consumer electronics products are remote controls, smoke alarms or appliances.",,,0,,,,,,,
The Z-Wave RF system operates in the sub Gigahertz frequency range (900 MHz) and it is optimized for low-overhead commands and reliable communication [6].,,,0,,,,,,,
ONE-NET is an open-source standard which defines the physical and network layers for wireless networks.,,,0,,,,,,,
"It was designed for low-cost, low-power control networks for applications such as home automation, security & monitoring, device control, and sensor networks.",,,0,,,,,,,
"ONE-NET is not tied to any proprietary hardware or software, and can be implemented with a variety of low-cost off-the-shelf radio transceivers and micro controllers from a number of different manufacturers.",,,0,,,,,,,
"ONE-NET is the only wireless control network that is based on the Open-Source philosophy (no royalties, freedom for use and modify, BSD license and Lots of design choices with open design standard).",,,0,,,,,,,
It operates in the 900 MHz band but additional frequencies are also possible [7].,,,0,,,,,,,
It is a proprietary solution devised by Coronis System in 2001 but standardized as open by the Wavenis-OSA.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Wavenis technology provides a platform to deploy Machine-to-Machine (M2M) applications such telemetry, industrial automation, home applications, etc.",,,0,,,,,,,
Its main strengths are ultra-low power consumption and long-range small amounts of data communications without the needed of Line of Sight (LOS) using the 900Mhz and 433Mhz band [8].,,,0,,,,,,,
"DASH7 (ISO 18000-7) is a new, trade alliance with the goal of increasing the market size for ultra-low-power wireless products.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Like ZigBee Alliance, DASH7 partners affectively address interoperability as well as the development of improved functions into the standard.",,,0,,,,,,,
"DASH7's range of more than 1 kilometer (433Mhz), multi-year battery life, and ability to penetrate walls and water make it preferable in several WSN applications.",,,1,,,,,,,
"DASH7 can be used with a variety of devices, from stand-alone DASH7 ""tags"" that monitor goods to mobile phones that allow consumers to monitor the energy usage in their own home [9].",,,0,,,,,,,
"Mi-Wi and MiWi P2P are proprietary wireless protocols designed by Microchip Technology that uses small, low-power digital radios based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.",,,0,,,,,,,
The technology aims to get low-data rate and short range distances by reducing the complexity of others WSN technologies (e.g. ZigBee) and reducing the footprint for constrained memory devices [10].,,,0,,,,,,,
"INSTEON is a robust, redundant dual-mesh network that combines wireless radio frequency (RF) with the home's existing electrical wiring.",,,0,,,,,,,
INSTEON is less susceptible than other single band networks to the kind of interference and noise commonly encountered within the home (900Mhz band).,,,0,,,,,,,
It leverages the latest digital technology to create a true peer-to-peer mesh network.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Because every INSTEON devices are flat, they do not require network supervision (network controllers and routing tables are not required).",,,1,,,,,,,
"On the power-line, INSTEON devices are compatible with legacy X102 [11].",,,0,,,,,,,
IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth) is another wireless link technology that falls under the WPAN classification.,,,0,,,,,,,
Bluetooth supports relatively high throughput for a limited number of nodes within a small range.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The key features of Bluetooth technology are robustness, low power, and low cost.",,,0,,,,,,,
The Bluetooth specification defines a uniform structure for a wide range of devices to connect and communicate with each other [12].,,,0,,,,,,,
"Bluetooth technology has achieved global acceptance such that any Bluetooth enabled device, almost everywhere in the world, can connect to other Bluetooth enabled devices in proximity.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Bluetooth enabled electronic devices connect and communicate wirelessly through short-range, ad hoc networks known as piconets.",,,0,,,,,,,
Each device can simultaneously communicate with up to seven other devices within a single piconet.,,,0,,,,,,,
Each device can also belong to several piconets simultaneously.,,,0,,,,,,,
Piconets are established dynamically and automatically as Bluetooth enabled devices enter and leave radio proximity.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Bluetooth technology operates in the unlicensed ISM band at 2.4 to 2.485 GHz, using a spread spectrum, frequency hopping and full-duplex signal.",,,0,,,,,,,
It is a digital radio technology (intended to become an open standard of wireless communications) designed for ultra low power consumption (button cell batteries) within a short range (10 meters) based around low-cost transceiver microchips in each device.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Wibree is not designed to replace Bluetooth, but rather to complement the technology in supported devices.",,,0,,,,,,,
Wibree-enabled devices will be smaller and more energy-efficient than their Bluetooth counterparts.,,,0,,,,,,,
It operates in the same ISM band with a bit rate of 1 Mbit/s as its “big brother”.,,,0,,,,,,,
"It primarily uses power line wiring for signaling and control, where the signals involve brief radio frequency bursts representing digital information.",,,0,,,,,,,
"UWB is defined as any radio technology having a spectrum that occupies a bandwidth greater than 20 percent of the center frequency, or a bandwidth of at least consumption for distances of less than 10 meters which can satisfy most of the multimedia applications such as audio and video delivery in home networking and it can also act as a wireless cable replacement of high speed serial bus such as USB where many devices are involved, low power is a must and high data rates are important (e.g. medical monitoring) [15].",,,0,,,,,,,
Since UWB operates at very high frequencies it has very high penetration loss which will significantly affect the performance and size of the network nodes.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Although UWB was claimed very low power initially in the literature, the attempts of such technology in the integrated circuits have exhibited power consumption more than that of the conventional narrowband short range wireless chips.",,,0,,,,,,,
A major drawback to date with UWB has been the standards issue.,,,0,,,,,,,
In January 2006 the IEEE abandoned its efforts for standardization or the 802.15.3a Task Group (TG3a).,,,0,,,,,,,
The two groups developing UWB technology failed to come to agreement on a single solution.,,,0,,,,,,,
Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) includes IEEE 802.11 that is an evolving family of specifications for WLANs developed by the IEEE working group.,,,0,,,,,,,
There are several (e.g. Sense Multiple Access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) for path sharing.,,,0,,,,,,,
The modulation used in newer 802.11 specifications is complementary code keying (CCK).,,,0,,,,,,,
The newer modulation methods provide higher data speed and reduced vulnerability to interference which permit users to surf Internet at broadband speeds when connected to an Access Point (AP) within the BSS (about 100m far) or in Ad hoc mode on the IBSS[16].,,,0,,,,,,,
"RFID is the most pervasive communication technology mainly used in the called Internet of Things (IoT)3, in fact, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) considers RFID a key enabler of the IoT concept.",,,0,,,,,,,
That is because its good standardized status and low price of the simplest units.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Main components of RFID technology are a transponders, interrogators and middleware.",,,0,,,,,,,
A transponder (tag) is attached to or implanted in an object.,,,0,,,,,,,
"RFID tags can be passive, semi-passive or active in nature, and information on tags can be read-only, read-write or rewritable[17].",,,0,,,,,,,
The communication between RFID tag and reader is performed using magnetic inductance (contactless).,,,0,,,,,,,
This mechanism can also provide enough power to allow passive tags to operate without internal power source when they are exposed to the reader’s magnetic field.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Passive tags have very limited range, but some active ones can offer a range of up to 100 meters.",,,0,,,,,,,
Information from the RFID objects is usually fed through some middleware application which forwards data to back-end systems for further processing or storage.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Normally one is not going to access objects directly, but utilize the data through back-end applications.",,,0,,,,,,,
"NFC is an extension of the ISO 14443, standardized in ISO 18092 and ISO 21481 using the frequency band of 13.56 MHz.",,,0,,,,,,,
NFC basically combines the operation of RFID transponder and interrogator (the reader) into one unit.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The range of operation is very limited, about 10 centimeters (via magnetic field induction), which allows high density of objects in a given space so that they do not interfere with each other [18].",,,1,,,,,,,
NFC is a combination of RFID contactless communication technology and wireless networking technology.,,,0,,,,,,,
The main difference between NFC and RFID is that in the NFC is possible to have a bidirectional transmission of information and NFC readers are primarily aimed at its usage in mobile phones.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The principal applications of this technology are the peer-to peer communication between NFC enabled devices, payment and ticketing applications on mobile phones (this was one of the drivers for the creation of the NFC standard) and services or communication initiation[19].",,,0,,,,,,,
"These can be wired or wireless connections providing connectivity with remote services, central processing units or data aggregation facilities.",,,0,,,,,,,
Examples would include WSNs connected back to environment monitoring information servers which are located in a monitoring centre.,,,0,,,,,,,
Often this link is referred to as 'backhaul' and it is the data pipe that brings the sensed data back to a centre where it can be processed.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Although narrowband solutions could be used if the data rates are low and network latency is permissible, the key breakthrough many times is the availability of Broadband technologies such as xDSL, WiMAX, 2.5 G (GPRS), 3G(UMTS) or satellite communications [20].",,,0,,,,,,,
We consider that it is relevant to seamlessly compare the main well know wireless communication standards since it is important to get an idea of which of them we are going to use in the DiYSE scenarios.,,,1,,,,,,,
"In fact, choosing a technology or another, we will likely obtain more or less advantages regarding coverage, topology, deployment, and so on.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Selecting the most appropriate networking technology for a specific application can be challenging, and one size does not fit all.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In some cases, a hybrid approach may be the best option, as we later show in the interoperability subsection.",,,0,,,,,,,
"For instance, a low-power, short-range subnet, such as ZigBee or 6LoWPAN aggregating sensor data for wide area communications across a GPRS/UMTS or Wi-Fi network.",,,0,,,,,,,
"With a growing selection of wireless networking alternatives, users are no longer confined to wired installations, and with cost-effective and reliable wireless products emerging based on global standards, users are no longer restricted to proprietary wireless approaches.",,,1,,,,,,,
In Figure 3 a comparative graphic with the most well known wireless communication standards is presented.,,,0,,,,,,,
In section 3.1.1. we have presented an overview of the WSN communication technologies which could be found in the current market.,,,0,,,,,,,
As we described there are some of them which have become standards and others that are emerging quickly and are intended to get the standardization soon.,,,0,,,,,,,
"For sensor-based systems that require the flexibility of a wireless network, and which can tolerate modest message latency, users can select between proprietary and standards-based solutions.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Since proprietary systems are usually customized to their application, they can offer benefits in transmission range, very low power consumption and per unit cost.",,,1,,,,,,,
"However, they are not generally more secure than standards based systems, and their proprietary nature means that they can’t achieve the high unit volumes and aggregated industry investment of standards-based systems [21].",,,0,,,,,,,
"Because the standardization is paramount to simplify and assure the broad use and applicability of the WSN technology, hereafter a comparison table of four of them (which we consider are probable candidates for the DiYSE scenarios) are presented4.",,,0,,,,,,,
In the table it has been showed their main technology features and on the bottom their weaknesses and strengths that should help us to decide which protocol we will apply in the each of the proposed scenarios.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In the next table we roughly compare IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth) wireless link technology, which falls also under the WPAN classification and IEEE 802.15.3 that pushes WPAN capabilities further, with greater throughput and support for more nodes.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Although both are intended for battery operation, they only target lifetimes of several days to several weeks.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In contrast, 802.15.4, which was before compared in Error!",,,0,,,,,,,
"Finally, the IEEE 802.11 standards (including Wi-Fi which is designed to substitute wires between devices) is also included in the comparative table.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In addition to this comparison, we can find many related studies in the literature.",,,0,,,,,,,
"For Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, Ferro and Potorti [24] compared their main features and behaviours in terms of various metrics, including consumption.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In addition, the power management of 802.15.3 is easier than that of 802.11e.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Since Bluetooth, ZigBee, 6LoWPAN, Wi-Fi and others use the 2.4GHz band, the coexistence issue between these standards must be dealt with.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Basically, Bluetooth and UWB provide adaptive frequency hopping to avoid channel collision, while ZigBee and Wi-Fi use dynamic frequency selection and transmission power control.",,,0,,,,,,,
IEEE 802.15.2 discussed the interference problem of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Also, Sikora and Groza [26] provided quantitative measurements of the coexistence issue for ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and microwave ovens.",,,0,,,,,,,
Regarding WSNs there are several studies towards the coexistence of this emerging technology.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In Figure 4 we can observe the range, band and data rate of the surveyed standards.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Applications might access devices through the usage of hierarchical names, using naming systems such as DNS or LDAP.",,,0,,,,,,,
DNS in particular is interesting because it allows to record service and device descriptions along with addressing information.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Using DNS, it is very well possible to obtain information concerning a single device by making use of different names.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Different applications can make use of different naming schemes, so that naming hierarchies can reflect the logic of an application.",,,1,,,,,,,
This enables application to build names according to their requirements.,,,0,,,,,,,
The same device becomes reachable using different categorizations.,,,0,,,,,,,
This means that it become possible to use different criteria for addressing a device.,,,1,,,,,,,
Location- based addressing for instance could compose DNS names by combining the names of different locations.,,,,0,,,,,,
They are used to create an alias for a DNS name with another DNS name that contains the actual information.,,,,0,,,,,,
This is useful to map a device under several categories.,,,,0,,,,,,
Typically PTR names contain the network protocol used to communicate with a device.,,,,0,,,,,,
"For instance, if a device implements a SOAP stack and is reachable as a HTTP server, it may have a PTR record under the name _http._tcp.domainname.org.",,,,1,,,,,,
These records are used to map the name of a device into an IP or IPv6 address.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The same name could be mapped into several IP addresses, which is ideal for multihoming.",,,,0,,,,,,
"In case of devices that are not directly connected to an IP network, this record will contain the address of the gateway through which it is possible yto reach the device.",,,,1,,,,,,
These records are useful to add extra service information beyond a name-address mapping.,,,,0,,,,,,
In fact SRV records may contain the TCP or UDP port number at which a particular service on a device is listening.,,,,0,,,,,,
This is useful whenever a device exposes more than one interface.,,,,1,,,,,,
"An application or device can use them to store specific device description informations, or links to them.",,,,0,,,,,,
"For instance, a service running inside a device could store a web link to its WSDL descriptor file.",,,,0,,,,,,
Applications that are based on onthologies could store links to their OWL descriptors.,,,,1,,,,,,
DPWS: Device Profile for Web Services is a set of specifications that enables devices to embed web service interfaces on them.,,,,1,,,,,,
Dynamic DNS: It is possible to dynamically send updates to the DNS server(s) whenever the situation of the internal network changes.,,,,1,,,,,,
In this way the DNS information are always up-to-date.,,,,0,,,,,,
REST: Representational State transfer is an architectural style that describes how to treat and manipulate stateful resources in a way that is similar/compatible with the behaviour of the World Wide Web.,,,,0,,,,,,
REST can be used by gateways to provide Web Applications with a representation of the internal state of a device.,,,,0,,,,,,
Devices that do not have direct access to an IP network will need to be accessible through a gateway.,,,,1,,,,,,
"The gateway must either be always on and enabled to receive incoming requests from the network, or may use existing network protocols to notifiy its devices to external parties.",,,,0,,,,,,
It could use a fixed scheme that maps each device to a different IP address/port/context path and provide the routing mechanism towards the internal network.,,,,0,,,,,,
Typically it will have to detect changes inside the internal network (e.g. a wireless device connecting or disconnecting) and map them into the IP connectivity layer.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Section 3.2.2 contains a list of protocols that may be useful to track the availability and lifecycle of devices, even when they are not directly connected to IP networks.",,,,0,,,,,,
Normally each non-IP mechanism contains provisions specifying how to detect signals about the presence of a device.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Device disconnection or unreachability is more difficult to track instead, and in this case applications must rely on keep alive mechanisms.",,,,0,,,,,,
"For instance, if Dynamic DNS is used to keep IP applications informed about the presence of a device, then every DNS update will have to contain a valid time to live entry that dictates when that DNS name has to expire.",,,,0,,,,,,
The Time-To-Live must be as close as possible to the duty cycle interval at which keep-alive messages are exchanged inside the internal network.,,,,0,,,,,,
Similar considerations apply to protocols like SIP.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Instead, protocols that are based on multicast discovery schemes like DPWS need to provide a way to propagate multicast messages outside the internal network.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Finally, if REST is adopted, it become possible to create applications that do not need to rely on presence information.",,,,1,,,,,,
In fact it is possible under REST to create a stateful resource in the network which acts as a remote agent for a specific device.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Under this model, the agent is always online and available for other devices and applications to communicate with even when its physical device is offline.",,,,0,,,,,,
"It is also possible to express presence as a resource, if needed.",,,,1,,,,,,
Approaches that are based on UDP like DPWS or DNS must use a way to describe a device that does not take too much space in terms of size.,,,,0,,,,,,
This is because the protocol adopted to send these information have inherent issues in sending large blocks of data.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Under these models it may be useful to put the device description aside (for instance, as a file on a web server) and propagate only the link to it.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This is what happens in DPWS Discovery, where a device sends only links to its description and not the description itself.",,,,0,,,,,,
Approaches such as REST allow a resource or device to provide a link to its description in the device state itself.,,,,1,,,,,,
The description of a device might differ from a protocol to another.,,,,0,,,,,,
Devices implementing SOAP interfaces may provide a WSDL file that describes the messages they accept/send.,,,,0,,,,,,
"A REST exposure of a device, on the contrary, could be self describing using tags but in general would not require the definition of an interface and rather rely on self-describing data types (usually through the specification of a MIME-Type).",,,,0,,,,,,
The Devices description working group has developed a core vocabulary to adapt content in Mobile Web.,,,,1,,,,,,
"There are “Aspect” that are the type of components (device, web browser, network connection…) and “Properties” to refer a specific “Aspect”.",,,,0,,,,,,
The vocabulary refers to [1] is a set of properties to define two specific aspect “web browser” and “devices”.,,,,0,,,,,,
The UWA Ontology [2] is recommended to extend the above vocabulary with other Properties.,,,,0,,,,,,
This ontology has a “Device” class which represents a device in the deliverable context and some of its properties.,,,,0,,,,,,
The core device ontology contains taxonomy of device types and basic device and manufacturer information.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The state machine model representing the concepts of states and transitions, which are updated in the run-time and represent the device/service actual status.",,,,0,,,,,,
FIPA is an internationals organization to promoting the industry of intelligent agents by openly developing specifications.,,,,0,,,,,,
The following table illustrates how define a devices with its most general properties.,,,,0,,,,,,
These models usually have a devices description as a fundamentally part of a context.,,,,0,,,,,,
"An Ontology-based Context Model in Intelligent Environments [7].This context ontologies are divided into upper ontology (high-level ontology which captures general context knowledge about the physical World, figure 3) and domain- specific ontologies (collection of low-level ontologies which define the details of general concepts and their properties in each sub-domain).",,,,0,,,,,,
The following figure shows an OWL/RDF graph in one scenario where CellPhone- John and Fridge-Kitchen are type of the class Device and are related with other elements in the context.,,,,0,,,,,,
Context Studio is an application personalisation tool for semi-automated context-based adaptation.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Context Studio has context ontology, with an enhanced vocabulary model, is utilized to offer scalable representation and easy navigation of context and action information in the UI.",,,,0,,,,,,
The ontology vocabulary hierarchy is transformed into a folder-file model representation in the graphical user interface.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Each context (object) is described using six properties: Context type, Context value, Source, Confidence, Timestamp, and Attributes [7].",,,,0,,,,,,
"Actions are defined with two properties, Action type and Action value, which describe actions as Context type and Context value describe contexts.",,,,0,,,,,,
"When an IP network is set up, it is possible to retrieve data from and manipulate devices through their IP interfaces.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Whenever devices do not support IP, it is necessary that a gateway in between the devices and IP networks understands and converts information between the two interfaces.",,,,1,,,,,,
It is important to observe that the application space should not be polluted with issues which are specific to a certain connectivity technology or else the application gets locked into it.,,,,0,,,,,,
An example of this is a network of ZigBee sensors that communicate with an IP-based application through a ZigBee-To-IP gateway.,,,,0,,,,,,
If the data from the sensors are tunneled to the IP entity as they are they may contain ZigBee-specific information (like the strength of the radio signal) which are “just there” although they may not be related with the measurement data at all.,,,,1,,,,,,
"This would require applications to be able to handle transport-specific data, and it should be avoided or the application would lock into that transport technology (ZigBee in this case).",,,,1,,,,,,
"On the other hand, some transport parameters should be made available for configuration through the IP interface.",,,,0,,,,,,
However the manipulation of these parameters should be made through a specific interface that should not be intertwined too much with the one used for data operations.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In general, pollution of the application space should be avoided especially when devices from different networking technologies are expected to communicate together (they will usually do that, either directly or indirectly through an IP network).",,,,1,,,,,,
At the IP level it is possible to use several protocol to exchange data and control information.,,,,1,,,,,,
SIP: the SIP protocol is ideal whenever data must be acquired in a conversational manner.,,,,1,,,,,,
It is the ideal when data producers operate by maintaining streams of information where clients subscribe and unsubscribe.,,,,0,,,,,,
Using the SIP protocol a stream producer could set up a SIP session and register itself into it as a stream producer.,,,,0,,,,,,
Consumers could just subscribe to that stream through a SIP URL.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The SIP URL of a given stream could, if not previously known, be registered under a DNS name using a DNS TXT record.",,,,1,,,,,,
The XMPP protocol is ideal when data and control data structures are sent using messages.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Instead of a session-based communication, XMPP favours a one-to-one approach, where endpoints send messages directly to each other.",,,,0,,,,,,
"XMPP URLs resemble those of emails, and, like emails, it is possible to keep messages in a storage memory when an endpoint is offline.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Therefore XMPP is better suited for loosely-coupled interaction, where device control may happen asynchronously.",,,,1,,,,,,
SOAP: SOAP is a protocol used to exchange data with a web service.,,,,0,,,,,,
It is possible (using software stacks like DPWS) to embed web service interfaces within devices.,,,,0,,,,,,
In case SOAP is used a device will expose its interface through a description language called WSDL.,,,,1,,,,,,
This description language relies on XSD (XML Schema Definition) in order to describe the structure of the data that can be exchanged with a device.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Given the client-server nature of SOAP, it is ideal for devices that can behave like servers, meaning that have a very high availability and are capable of servicing a great amount of traffic.",,,,1,,,,,,
"However, given the faulty nature of hardware, SOAP clients should not assume the services to be always up and running, and provide a buffer solution for downtimes.",,,,1,,,,,,
"REST: With REST, it is possible for every device to maintain its own resources inside the network, and to store its exported data over there.",,,,1,,,,,,
This has the advantage that data is available even when a device is offline.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Likewise, control information could be put inside a resource by a device-controlling application, and have the device periodically read them (or being notified through HTTP Server Push), especially after it goes online.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Therefore REST is a compelling solution when having to manage loosely-coupled systems, where the different system components and devices have different uptimes.",,,,1,,,,,,
"IP-based security is a broad topic that has been covered extensively over the years, and here we provide just the basics of it.",,,,0,,,,,,
Almost all of the authentication and authorization technologies in the IP world are based on data encryption.,,,,0,,,,,,
Infrastructure) where a trusted certificate authority provides the infrastructure to create and verify digital signatures of messages.,,,,0,,,,,,
"This enables entities to understand whether a message is original or fake, and to protect messages with a varying degree of protection.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Every entity in the system has one or more roles associated with it (which are normally stored somewhere, most of the times in a LDAP repository) which determines which actions it can performs and where.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This allows devices to check whether a request message is coming from a trusted source, and if that source has the rights to ask that request to be performed.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Also, the device will be able to encrypt the response in a way that only the intended destination will understand.",,,,0,,,,,,
Particular care must be done at the boundary between IP and non-IP networks.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In fact, most of the times the security mechanisms that have been in place in an IP network won’t work outside of it.",,,,0,,,,,,
"A possible way to ensure that end-to-end security is achieved is to encrypt messages at the level of the native device network (USB, ZigBee, X10 and so on) using the same PKI infrastructure in use at the IP level.",,,,0,,,,,,
"However, this requires the gateway to act as a simple tunnel for the data packets, which means that there is the risk of polluting the application space with device-dependent data.",,,,1,,,,,,
Another constraint to this solution is given by the limitations of the devices themselves.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In fact most of them have limited memory and processing power, meaning that supporting encryption at the native level is not always possible.",,,,1,,,,,,
"However, the problem could be mitigated if wired networking is used and the wired network is situated at a secure location.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Too bad, most native technologies (a part IEEE 802.11, which comes with an advanced and flexible security stack) do not provide more than simple data integrity checks (like parity checks or CRCs) but with no built-in security.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This implies that security at the native level would require additions to existing standards, which may be impractical, especially for the sake of interoperability.",,,,1,,,,,,
Devices could communicate between entities using different networking protocols only if a protocol translation occurs.,,,,1,,,,,,
"However, given the sheer number of connecting technologies, it is not scalable to think in terms of protocol-to-protocol conversion.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Instead, a common language or framework needs to be set up.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This framework is IP, which is the building block of every networking protocol on the Internet.",,,,0,,,,,,
Schemes for translating native protocols into IP can be implemented at the gateway level as defined in section 3.5.2.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Simple and inexpensive objects, as WSN devices are, will not be equipped with large-scale active intelligence, so the data they produce and the communication methods they use to transmit the data are also relatively simple.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Objects may transmit information between similar kinds of objects quite easily, but when data needs to be transferred upstream into real Internet or through another neighbour network, it is not feasible to make every object handle all the burden of the TCP/IP stack, to give an example.",,,,1,,,,,,
"On the other hand, if we desire to merge two wireless networks in order they can cooperate (e.g. interconnect WSNs with the Internet), there are many approaches in the literature that have proposed solutions.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Overlay network is usually built on top of the Internet, and uses late address binding to achieve the independence of the underlying bearer protocols and addressing schemes.",,,,0,,,,,,
Modified TCP allows running TCP/IP protocol suite directly in the WSNs [54].,,,,1,,,,,,
"Regardless these approaches are focused on merging Internet with WSN, they could be also applied to interconnect other wireless networks.",,,,0,,,,,,
"On MIMOSA Project the personal mobile phone is chosen as interface to Ambient Intelligence and a gateway between the sensors (RFID), the network of sensors, the public network and the Internet [57].",,,,0,,,,,,
"AlarmNet is another research project which integrates heterogeneous devices, some wearable on the patient and some placed inside the living space to monitor the ambient changes from an outer data centre (Bluetooth, tags, WSN, Wi-Fi, backbone) [60].",,,,0,,,,,,

This section addresses the challenges and state-of-the-art technologies for enriching raw data from heterogeneous devices to provide high-level information to WP3 reasoning.,,,,0,,,,,,
"On the proposed DiYSE scenarios there will be a huge number of heterogeneous devices (sensors, actuators, PDA’s, smart phones, etc.).",,,,0,,,,,,
"Several of them are resource constrained, specially the individual devices in a WSN.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The WSN are closely coupled to a changing physical world, then, the nodes forming the network will experience wide variations in connectivity and will be subject to potentially harsh environmental conditions.",,,,0,,,,,,
"In order to avoid this issue, the referred nodes have substantial processing capability in the aggregate, but not individually, so we must combine their many vantage points on the physical phenomena within the network itself.",,,,1,,,,,,
This is one of the primal objectives of what we have named “virtual sensors”.,,,,0,,,,,,
"On the other hand, by using the combined information, the virtual sensors have also the capability of reasoning by using fusion techniques5.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The aim of this latter case, is to offer to requester nodes a high and enriched information that is collected from the surrounding sensors.",,,,0,,,,,,
"It is important to stress that for us, a virtual sensor has all the properties of a real sensor, with respect to its capability to communicate the sensed data, but the information that it offers to a requester node is derived from information already processed in other surrounding nodes.",,,,0,,,,,,
"However, the information derived from a virtual sensor itself can be treated in the same fashion as a real one.",,,,0,,,,,,
What is challenging of our proposal is that the fused information should be retrieved from many different and heterogeneous real sensors.,,,,0,,,,,,
"For instance, let us think to an actor that wants to know if a specific person is inside a room.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Instead of interrogate every potential sensor inside the room (wasting time and resources –recall the constrained features of sensors), the actor only needs to retrieve the information that it desires from the virtual sensor.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Even more, the supposed actor should not need to get into the room to retrieve the referred information and therefore it should not have the necessity of discover every sensor instance within the room since the virtual sensor does its best for it.",,,,1,,,,,,
The idea of merging heterogeneous sources to get an enrich information and the concept of virtual sensor are not new.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In fact, we can find some related examples in the literature: Stefano Piva et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Currently, data fusion systems are used extensively for target tracking, automated identification of targets, and limited automated reasoning applications [2].",,,,0,,,,,,
"In their work, the authors provide a solution to allow for sets of heterogeneous sensors, namely CCD video cameras and WLAN 802.11b radio devices, to be integrated in order to extract biometric information (position and ID) regarding objects in a given environment of interest.",,,,1,,,,,,
Robot teams have the advantage that they can collectively share information.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Then, they are able to fuse range information from a variety of different platforms to build a global occupancy map that represent a single collective view of the environment.",,,,1,,,,,,
A virtual sensor is simply an abstraction of the team’s occupancy map [3].,,,,0,,,,,,
Their virtual sensors abstraction connects users directly to sensors in the local environment.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Virtual sensors can be deployed on small devices, operate independently of heavyweight infrastructure, and provide on-demand, real- time connection to information that enables users to complete their tasks quickly, safely, and with the best possible information.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The same authors in [6] and [1] define a kind of virtual sensors that abstract a set of physical sensors and the operations that are performed on them, providing a new way of extracting data from heterogeneous wireless sensors.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Moreover, their virtual sensors also offer a way to tailor a generic sensing environment to specific applications, which will be especially necessary as sensor networks become more widespread and general purpose.",,,,0,,,,,,
We will follow their work trying to go beyond it since their contributions have a major impact for the DiYSE virtual sensors.,,,,0,,,,,,
Also in the literature we have found virtual sensors from the point of view of their implementation.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In [9], a set of programming abstractions that allow a programmer to interact with several nodes (specified in a declarative way) as if they were a single virtual node is presented.",,,,1,,,,,,
"That is achieved by relieving programmers from the details of data collection, allowing them to focus on the application logic.",,,,1,,,,,,
"To conclude this section, in the literature we have also found approaches using the concept of virtual sensors towards the seamless interoperability of different communication protocols and to simplify the applications development for integrated services involving multiple types of sensors [10].",,,,0,,,,,,
In-door localization is about to determine the node's location (position) within the network [11] .It means for a node to determine its physical position (with respect to some coordinate system) or its symbolic location.,,,,0,,,,,,
In this section we will review the techniques to compute the node’s localization by presenting initially the methods that are used to estimate the distance to beacon/anchor nodes6 and then the types of signal and models used to get those estimations.,,,,0,,,,,,
"This first technique uses the time of transmission, the known signal propagation speed and the time of arrival of such signal in order to compute the distance between two nodes in the WSN.",,,,1,,,,,,
"This technique is simple and efficient but it presents problems such exact time synchronization among nodes, reflections, and overhead.",,,,0,,,,,,
"However the main drawback is that it is difficult to precisely record the arrival time of radio signals, since they travel close to the light speed.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Therefore, it works best with an acoustic source as is proposed in [12] and [40].",,,,1,,,,,,
This approach uses two different signals with different propagation speed (e.g. ultrasound and radio signal).,,,,0,,,,,,
To estimate the distance it computes the difference between signals arrival time.,,,,1,,,,,,
The signals propagation speed must be known but it improves upon the ToA by eliminating the need to know when the signal was transmitted.,,,,1,,,,,,
Problems: Limited coverage (3-15m) and high dependency of the density of nodes within the WSN (number of nodes and connectivity).,,,,0,,,,,,
It is a method for determining the propagation direction of a radio-frequency wave incident on an antenna array.,,,,0,,,,,,
The AoA determines the direction by measuring the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) at individual elements of the array -from these delays the AoA can be calculated – usually the antennas array uses a direction of reference.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Problems: Calibration, expensive/energy-intensive hardware, high cost.",,,,0,,,,,,
The nodes which use this method send out a signal of known strength (using the signal attenuation) and after they use the received signal strength and the path loss coefficient to estimate the distance to the known location .,,,,1,,,,,,
"Another use for RSSI is profiling, in which a map of RSSI values is constructed during an initial training phase.",,,,0,,,,,,
Sensors then estimate their position by matching observed RSSI values with the training data.,,,,0,,,,,,
Those nodes are very used in the distance estimation techniques but it has its shortcoming.,,,,0,,,,,,
It does not scale well in large networks and problems may arise due to environmental conditions.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Recently, there have been several published techniques that determine the position of a node based on the observed frequency of a signal [17][18].",,,,0,,,,,,
Signal frequency will undergo Doppler-shift when the transmitter and receiver are moving relative to one another.,,,,1,,,,,,
The observed Doppler-shift at multiple infrastructure nodes can be used to derive the position and velocity of the mobile node.,,,,0,,,,,,
In the last section we have reviewed the techniques to estimate the node location or its position within a wireless sensor network.,,,,0,,,,,,
In most of them it has been specified the use of different types and modes of signals for the estimation purposes.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Next, we summarize these signals and the used methods as well as we address the research papers and projects where they have applied.",,,,0,,,,,,
Ultrasound is a cyclic sound pressure with a frequency greater than the upper limit of human hearing that is approximately 20 KHz.,,,,0,,,,,,
These systems use both ultrasound and radio signal.,,,,0,,,,,,
The localization is hence performed by calculating the difference of the ToA of the referred signals [19][19][20] and [21] use this method.,,,,1,,,,,,
Infrared radiation (IR) is an electromagnetic radiation with a frequency range between 1 THz and 430 THz.,,,,0,,,,,,
The infrared-based localization systems use infrared light to perform their calculations to get the node localization by measuring the constrained to the device Line of Sight (LoS) and a proper orientation to the transmitters.,,,,0,,,,,,
Radio frequency systems employ a transmitted signal that is received by some mobile devices within the network.,,,,0,,,,,,
These systems are commonly used since almost all type of WSN communication standard use this carrier.,,,,1,,,,,,
"The RF is used in several estimation techniques such as the received signal strength intensity, angle of arrival, time of flight and after it is employed by triangulation to calculate the node’s position Visible light communication systems can provide solutions to the frequency band communications since light is not interfering with the crowded radio frequency band.",,,,1,,,,,,
These systems employ sound signals instead of ultrasound signal to avoid the signal attenuation.,,,,1,,,,,,
Usually these acoustic signals are used in distance estimation techniques that compare the differences on arrival of two or more signals with different propagation speed.,,,,0,,,,,,
They use Ultra high Frequency (UHF) and Very High Frequency (VHF) signals to perform their calculations.,,,,0,,,,,,
Ultra-wideband (UWB) is a radio technology that can be used at very low energy levels for short-range high-bandwidth communications by using a large portion of the radio spectrum.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The ultra wide band systems employ a high frequency signal, above TOA to calculate the position by triangulation [28].",,,,0,,,,,,
"A Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) links devices through a wireless distribution method (typically spread-spectrum or OFDM radio), and usually provides connection to the Internet using Access Points (APs).",,,,0,,,,,,
WLAN location systems employ the exiting Wi-Fi network infrastructure access points.,,,,0,,,,,,
The systems measure the received signal strength to perform calculations to get the estimated position of nodes within the range or cell.,,,,0,,,,,,
These systems must deal with multipath and Non-LOS problems.,,,,0,,,,,,
WLAN systems often use probabilistic models to mitigate such problems as is demonstrated in [29] and [30].,,,,1,,,,,,
Bluetooth is an open standard and a communication protocol primarily designed for the exchange of data in low power consumption networks with short range of communication (i.e. Personal Area Networks - PANs).,,,,0,,,,,,
In such networks (PicoNets) the Bluetooth localization systems use the received signal strength intensity to calculate the position of the devices inside the network [31].,,,,0,,,,,,
"Because the devices use a radio (broadcast) communications system, they do not have to be in the LoS of each other and the synchronization is avoided.",,,,1,,,,,,
"ZigBee is a specification for a suite of high level communication protocols using small, low power digital radios based on the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 standard for wireless personal area networks.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The systems which make use of this technology, as the Bluetooth ones, employ the received signal strength intensity to calculate the position of the mobile devices [32].",,,,0,,,,,,
RFID location systems deploy a number of readers in the area where the tags will surely move around.,,,,0,,,,,,
By reading and identifying the tags (Assuming that the readers are placed in a well known position) the distance or the placement of nodes estimation is calculated.,,,,1,,,,,,
The RSSI intensity is used again as is demonstrated in [33] and also in the WhereNet project [34] .,,,,0,,,,,,
Most of these systems use printed codes or patterns that can be recognized by Webcams or IP cameras.,,,,0,,,,,,
The code gives information about the position or the number of objects that could be in a room.,,,,0,,,,,,
Another proposed technique attached to artificial vision is the named “schema analysis”.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The well known GPS system is composed of three parts: between 24 and 32 satellites in Medium Earth Orbit, four control and monitoring stations on Earth and the actual navigation devices.",,,,0,,,,,,
"GPS satellites broadcast signals from space that GPS receivers use to provide three-dimensional location (latitude, longitude, and altitude) time.",,,,0,,,,,,
Then a GPS receiver calculates its position by precisely timing the signals sent by the GPS satellites [36][37].,,,,1,,,,,,
The main drawback of this technique is its limited use in outside environments.,,,,0,,,,,,
However with the appearance of systems like Assisted-GPS (A-GPS) the trend go towards the use of this technology also over indoor environments.,,,,0,,,,,,
These systems use magnetic readers and magnetic tags.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Using the distance estimation methods with different signal modalities previously sorted, it is possible to get accurate node’s location within the WSN by applying any of the next position estimation techniques.",,,,1,,,,,,
This first technique estimates a node position by computing the node’s distances to three non-linear points with their location is beforehand known.,,,,0,,,,,,
"To compute the distances to anchors, the trilateration make use of the previously reviewed distance estimation techniques.",,,,1,,,,,,
"For a 2-Dimensions space, three anchors are enough but for several localization works such [12] and [39].",,,,1,,,,,,
"When a node desires to compute its position but the anchors are not in the node’s range, it makes use of its neighbor nodes as relays to reach the beacon nodes and eventually compute its current position.",,,,1,,,,,,
Count the number of hops assuming that the length of one hop is known (DV-Hop).,,,,0,,,,,,
"If there exist a range estimate between neighbors, use them to improve the total length of route estimation in the previously defined method (DV- Distance).",,,,1,,,,,,
"It is similar to Trilateration, but rather than distances, angles are used to determine a node position.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Generally, to compute the position two angles plus a distance between two well known anchors are needed (2 Dimensions - for 3 Dimensions also the azimuth is used).",,,,1,,,,,,
This estimation technique is very useful in a network of phased antennas array where different receptors with a well-known distances measure the ToA of the target signals and compute the angle.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Multilateration, also known as hyperbolic positioning, is the process of locating an object by accurately computing TDoA of a signal emitted from that object to three or more receivers.",,,,0,,,,,,
It also refers to the case of locating a receiver by measuring the TDoA of a signal transmitted from three or more synchronized transmitters.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Multilateration should not be confused with trilateration, which uses distances or absolute measurements of ToA from three or more anchors.",,,,1,,,,,,
It makes use of neighbor nodes to determine their position and then those act as beacons for other nodes.,,,,0,,,,,,
"For instance, assume that some nodes can hear at least three anchors (to perform triangulation), but not all.",,,,0,,,,,,
Let more and more nodes compute position estimates and spread their position knowledge in the network.,,,,0,,,,,,
The infrastructure is created in an Ad-hoc manner but the problem mainly arises on errors propagation and high computation in every node.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The main drawback is that this technique requires compiling a database of features, thus extensive infrastructure.",,,,1,,,,,,
This technique aims to determine when an object is near of a well-known location instead of compute the specific or accurate space locations.,,,,0,,,,,,
Monitoring or polling wireless Access Points (APs).,,,,0,,,,,,
"This third method aims to combine the use of different identification techniques such as credit cards, logins, registers, and footprints, IDS to know the approximate node location.",,,,0,,,,,,
It is important to remark that these three methods could be applied in any of the proposed DiYSE scenarios since most of them looks for objects or people tracking This technique is overall used in Robotics.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Robots obtain their current velocity from wheel encoders or other means, and use this information in conjunction with the amount of time that has elapsed since the last update to derive current position and heading [41][41].",,,,0,,,,,,
"The major drawback of this approach is that the position estimation accrues error over time, primarily because of noisy encoder data due to uneven surfaces, wheel slippage, dust, and other factors [42].",,,,1,,,,,,
"Multilateration problematic (convergence, accuracy).",,,,0,,,,,,
In the DiYSE project we will aim to solve some of these issues and to go beyond the presented literature approaches.,,,,0,,,,,,
Nevertheless we will use and combine the basis of localization in WSN in the proposed scenarios to reach our targets.,,,,0,,,,,,
A very important concern related with localization is people and objects identification.,,,,0,,,,,,
In many cases when a person or an object is located it is also identified but most of the times in an inaccurate way.,,,,1,,,,,,
There exits hence several techniques to locate and identify people and objects inside a WSN in a proper way.,,,,1,,,,,,
The identification systems intended for monitoring and tracking people in both indoor and outdoor areas have become increasingly important.,,,,0,,,,,,
The efficient tracking of many people motion in either large buildings or outdoor areas are still relatively difficult tasks.,,,,0,,,,,,
"There are several standard systems working in the Identification (ID) of low frequency or high frequency rates, but during the ID process, the tracked person or the object must somehow touch or be near to the reader or even insert an ID card into a reader.",,,,1,,,,,,
Next we present some of the most well know identification systems: RFID Systems use tags with a microchip as a data-carrying device.,,,,0,,,,,,
These tags have a Unique IDentification (UID) code.,,,,0,,,,,,
The RFID systems are completed with a tag reader that interrogates the mobile tags to get theirs UID and an interface to a host application such as a computer to allocate such UIDs.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In the referred systems, the targets that are being monitored are not required to perform any action during the ID process, that is, to be computationally headless [43][44][45] and [45].",,,,1,,,,,,
From [46] a tracking system for a constant ﬂow of targets in which the speed of the targets is determined using previous sensor measurements is presented.,,,,0,,,,,,
The new obtained data is continuously updated by using the current sensor measurements dependent of the previous ones.,,,,1,,,,,,
"In [47][47] another tracking system is presented, the authors modify the layer two MAC protocol of the RFID standard to get as faster as possible the tags ID.",,,,0,,,,,,
The systems based in the wireless LAN technology use the MAC address to perform the connection to the network.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Hence, it is straightforward to get the device ID since MAC addresses are unique and therefore the nodes are perfectly indentified.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Bluetooth is an open wireless protocol for exchanging data over short distances from fixed and mobile devices, creating personal area networks called piconets or scatternets which are limited to seven devices.",,,,0,,,,,,
"As in WLAN, the network identification use unique MAC addresses [12][12].",,,,0,,,,,,
"ZigBee is a specification for a suite of high level communication protocols using small, low power digital radios based on the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 standard for wireless PANs.",,,,0,,,,,,
Zigbee has not the Bluetooth limitation of the number of nodes belonging to a network.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Moreover, Zigbee provides two ways of identifying nodes, by using the devices MAC address and a two bytes address to identify the node into the current wireless sensor network.",,,,0,,,,,,
Both methods could be used to indentify uniquely the nodes within the network [32].,,,,0,,,,,,
Most of these systems use printed codes or patterns that can be recognized by Webcams.,,,,0,,,,,,
There are several research projects with the main focus put on the management of context and knowledge information.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The gathering of that information involves three main different aspects: the description, the storage and retrival, and the acquisition of information.",,,,0,,,,,,
This section is going to cover two of these issues: the description and the storage due these two aspects are the most important ones in order to communicate the information to the application layer (WP3).,,,,1,,,,,,
DANAE project [49] aimed at providing a complete framework for not only describing multimedia information but also for transporting this information to the user with the best QoS taking into account the session context information.,,,,0,,,,,,
"ITACITUS project [50], where a distributed cultural resources repository is to be offered to the visitor or researcher.",,,,0,,,,,,
AMBIESENSE project [51] the end user is a mobile citizen surrounded by an intelligent environment which senses the contextual information and offers personalized services.,,,,0,,,,,,
In this case context tags are used to implement the context-aware technologies.,,,,1,,,,,,
"The main objective of the project is to define and implement a platform to simplify and speed up the task of developing and deploying mobile services, making it commercially feasible for the wider IT industry (not just telecom companies) to provide such services.",,,,1,,,,,,
"With respect to the storage and retrieval of context information, many content-aware multimedia services have been presented in the literature, such as content-based retrieval, content-based navigation and real-time video streaming.",,,,0,,,,,,
A Classification Framework for Storage and Retrieval of Context [55].,,,,0,,,,,,
This paper presents a classification framework for the storage of the context model and the retrieval of the context information from the context model.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The context model is used to add context meaning to the raw monitoring data, and is thus a necessary element for most context-aware systems.",,,,1,,,,,,
"After the context model adds meaning to the raw monitoring data, the resulting context information is used by the system.",,,,0,,,,,,
Adaptive storage and retrieval of large compressed images [56].,,,,0,,,,,,
"Enabling the efficient storage, access and retrieval of large volumes of multidimensional data is one of the important emerging problems in databases.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This paper presents a framework for adaptively storing, accessing, and retrieving large images.",,,,0,,,,,,
"By adapting to user access patterns, the system selects and stores those view elements that yield the lowest average cost for accessing the multi-resolution sub region image views.",,,,0,,,,,,
Context-Aware GRID Services: Issues and Approaches [57].,,,,0,,,,,,
This paper contains a section related to context management system.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The context management service uses the context gathering and publishing service, the context retrieval service and the context storage service.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Context information is obtained from a wide plethora of applications, services and sensors (collectively called context sources) spread all over the network.",,,,0,,,,,,
The job of the context gathering service is to collect this information and put it into a common model understood and accessible by all components of the context service.,,,,0,,,,,,
This highly distributed characteristic introduces a great challenge for the manageability of all this information.,,,,1,,,,,,
Hence there is a need for a common context information model and a context publishing protocol.,,,,1,,,,,,
The context is then stored in a context information base for access by context consumers through the context retrieval service.,,,,0,,,,,,
The relationship between the context sources and consumers are shown in figure 1 below.,,,,0,,,,,,
Towards a Conceptual Model for Context-Aware Adaptive Services [58] Recent advances in both portable devices and wireless networks make mobile computing a reality.,,,,0,,,,,,
Embedded and invisible computing resources are paving the way to a new paradigm known as pervasive computing.,,,,0,,,,,,
More attention needs to be paid to the development of intelligent services in such a highly dynamic environment.,,,,0,,,,,,
This paper aims to present a conceptual model for context awareness based service adaptation methodology.,,,,0,,,,,,

"Given the broad spectrum of research subjects in that area, we will identify the potential and the major challenges raised by its use in DiYSE applications, and analyze the associated requirements and state-of-the-art.",,,,1,,,,,,
Coulouris et al [1] define a distributed system “as one in which hardware or software components located at networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions only by passing messages”.,,,,0,,,,,,
Wang in [1] claims that one of the main challenges of distributing computing comes from the conflict between the contexts of distributed computing and the embedded sensor devices.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Distributed computing should support scalability, reliability, dependability, and heterogeneity, but this demands the careful the design under the context of resource limited devices and dynamic network topology.",,,,1,,,,,,
"In order to provide the above mentioned high level services, while providing support for the existing heterogeneity in Wireless Sensor Networks architectures, a middleware layer is required.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Middleware for sensor networks can be considered as a software infrastructure that glues together the network hardware, operating systems, network stacks, and applications.",,,,0,,,,,,
"A complete middleware solution should contain a runtime environment that supports and coordinates multiple applications, and standardized system services, such as data aggregation, control and management policies adapting to target applications.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Also, middleware software architectures should offer mechanisms to achieve adaptive and efficient system resources use, in order to prolong the sensor network's life.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Different middleware approaches were found, García in [3] has classified these approaches, taking into account the programming models in sensor networks, see Fig.",,,,0,,,,,,
Programming sensor networks includes two major classes: programming support and programming abstraction.,,,,0,,,,,,
Manage to the way a sensor network is viewed and presents concepts and ideas of sensor nodes and sensor data.,,,,0,,,,,,
There are two main approaches for programming abstraction classes the global behavior and the local behavior approaches.,,,,0,,,,,,
"This first programming abstraction approach, the sensor network is programmed as whole rather than writing low-level software to drive individual nodes.",,,,0,,,,,,
A global WSN’s behavior is programmed at a high-level specification that enables node concerned about dealing with low-level.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Some examples of this approach are: Kairos [4], Regiment [5], Abstract Task Graph [6] and Semantic Streams [7].",,,,0,,,,,,
This second programming abstraction approach deals with the behavior of the sensor network nodes from a local point of view in a distributed computation.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The local behavior approach focuses on the nature of the sensed data and, in particular, on a specific location in a sensor network.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Manage the providing systems, services, and run-time mechanisms, such a reliable code distribution, safe code execution, and application-specific services.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The programming support class consists of five approaches (see Fig.1): virtual machine-based, modular programming-based, database-based, application-driven, and message-oriented middleware.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This approach consists of virtual machines, interpreters and mobile agents.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Its main characteristic is flexibility, allowing developers to write applications in divided small modules, which are injected and distributed through the network by the system using tailored algorithms and then interpreted by the virtual machine.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Some examples of this approach are: Maté [12], Squawk [13].",,,,0,,,,,,
The use of mobile code facilitates the injection and distribution through the network and leads to application modularity.,,,,1,,,,,,
Less energy is necessary when broadcasting small modules instead of the complete application.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Some examples of this approach are: Impala [14], Smart Messages Project [15].",,,,0,,,,,,
"This approach observes the entire network as a virtual database system, offering an easy-to-use interface that permits the user extract data of interest and issue queries about the sensor network.",,,,1,,,,,,
The database is one of the earliest examples of high-level abstractions for sensor network programming.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Some examples of this approach, TinyDB [16], SINA [17], DSWare [18] and MiLAN [19], which in addition to these features, provides a data service that features QoS support.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This approach is quite suitable in pervasive environments such as Wireless Sensor Networks, where most applications are based on events.",,,,0,,,,,,
Message-oriented middleware uses the publish-subscribe mechanism to facilitate message exchange between nodes and the sink nodes.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Many applications, which are deployed over Wireless Sensor Networks, are context- aware.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Therefore, it is necessary to found mechanisms in order to get context information from the environment in a structured way.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Besides, this information has to be meaningful from the application point of view.",,,,0,,,,,,
"In this sense, the middleware layer in Wireless Sensor Networks has to implement some mechanisms in order to reach efficient deployments of context applications over Wireless Sensor Networks.",,,,1,,,,,,
Since each application interprets the underlying sensor network differently according requirements.,,,,0,,,,,,
The middleware layer proposed in [22] is based on an execution Framework.,,,,0,,,,,,
"That Framework is able to manage contextual information by using an architecture divided in three sub-layers: Context Provider, Context Process and Context Adapter.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The middleware’s life cycle is divided in three phases: acquisition of context data, interpretation of context information and adaptation according to identified situation.",,,,0,,,,,,
The Context Provider layer provides “crude” data about the environment and sensor status.,,,,0,,,,,,
The Context Process layer filters and aggregate the crude data from Context Provider.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The higher layer, Context Adapter, is able to take decisions about the convenience of performing an adaptation.",,,,0,,,,,,
"In this proposal there are context nodes which provide context information by using five primitive components: Context Process, Context Reasoning, Context Configuration, Activity Manager, and Message Manager.",,,,0,,,,,,
In [23] a middleware for contextual agents was proposed.,,,,0,,,,,,
This middleware layer was thought with the purpose of compose an execution Framework suitable for agents in ubiquitous computing environment.,,,,0,,,,,,
The contextual model implemented by this proposal allows using different reasoning mechanisms like first order logic and temporal logic.,,,,1,,,,,,
"The types of agents and services coexisting in this middleware are the following ones: Context Providers, Context Synthesizer, Context Consumer, Context Provider Searching Service, Historic Context Service and Ontology Service.",,,,0,,,,,,
The most of WSN solutions are based on arrays of homogeneous sensors.,,,,0,,,,,,
"To solve the three major problems in WSNs mentioned above, a Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) was proposed in [24].",,,,1,,,,,,
This approach allows semantically tagging the sensed data from a heterogeneous distributed sensor network in order to ease the managing of contextual data in a large scale network.,,,,1,,,,,,
In [25] a Context Aware Sensornet (CASN) was proposed.,,,,0,,,,,,
CASN integrates the contextual computing theory [26] with sensor networks concept.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In CASN, the node’s context is most important than the human context.",,,,1,,,,,,
This approach implies several challenges as a suitable behavior abstraction or the technologies required for context representation in an energy-efficient way.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The middleware’s framework is composed of four main components: Context Representation Component, Context Interpreter Component, Contextual Service Component, and the Kernel of the node.",,,,0,,,,,,
The Context Representation Component uses a lightweight ontology called µSONG (Micro Sensornet Ontology) which provides a simple and flexible way of presenting the context.,,,,0,,,,,,
The context interpretation is achieved by using an interpreter based on fuzzy rules called CIBFR (Context Interpreter Based on Fuzzy Rule).,,,,1,,,,,,
In [27] a rule based Middleware called MIDSEN was proposed.,,,,0,,,,,,
This proposal includes two major algorithms: event detection algorithm (EDA) and context aware service discovery algorithm (CASDA).,,,,0,,,,,,
Both algorithms are implemented by inference engine.,,,,0,,,,,,
MIDSEN defines sensors and applications as services.,,,,0,,,,,,
EDA takes an input as sensor readings and makes an event primitive.,,,,0,,,,,,
A primitive event is built by event detection time and event format.,,,,0,,,,,,
"By matchmaking, CASDA discovers services, which match with given service request.",,,,1,,,,,,
"However, each proposal used its own language to represent that information.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Currently, there is not a standard to formalize the representation of information which is managed in resource constrained systems as Wireless Sensor Networks.",,,,0,,,,,,
"In this sense, several representation models have been proposed to be used in Wireless Sensor Networks.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Between them, we can found WISNO (WIreless Sensor Networks Ontology) [28].",,,,0,,,,,,
WISNO includes an ontology divided in two levels: high and low.,,,,0,,,,,,
The high level ontology is used to perform a fine analysis of contextual information.,,,,0,,,,,,
The low level ontology is used to characterize the data from sensors which are deployed around the Wireless Sensor Networks.,,,,0,,,,,,
Reasoning rules based on descriptive logic and SWRL [29] have also included in WISNO specification.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Another proposal, which is based on formalized representation system of sensor information, is [30].",,,,0,,,,,,
In this proposal each sensor provides an energy level as well as its status.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The condition of every sensor integrated into the node is described by the following quadruple: <t, m, e, a>, where t is the sensor type, m is the operator type, e is the energy consumption of that sensor, and a is the sensor precision.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The dynamic information of each sensor can be summarized in tuples like <E, {S}>, where E is the remaining energy level and {S} is the set of one or more quadruples which describe the status of the sensors in the node.",,,,0,,,,,,
Sensors and actuators use to have a very small process capability.,,,,0,,,,,,
These devices are starting to deploy real distributed systems.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In this sense, the concept of artificial intelligence is starting to be included into sensors and actuators [31].",,,,0,,,,,,
"Different paradigms have been used to perform this intelligence, like knowledge based systems [32], fuzzy logic [33][34] or artificial neural networks [35].",,,,0,,,,,,
Deckneuvel [31] reported an analysis of intelligent sensor and purposed a language specifically developed for the design of these systems.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Lately, hybrid systems, which are composed of fuzzy logic and neural network, have been proposed Averkin and Belenki [37].",,,,0,,,,,,
"In [38], the use of a distributed rule based fuzzy logic engine designed for collaborative WSN has been described.",,,,0,,,,,,
Wireless Sensor Network consists of a multitude of tiny embedded devices that are capable of sensing information continually and transmit data from one device to another via a wireless ad hoc network.,,,,0,,,,,,
Such networks are characterized by their ease of deployment and being self-configuring.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Nowadays, the applications of WSN technology have been broken down into two main categories: Monitoring and Tracking.",,,,0,,,,,,
"One of the most important features of the WSN for DiYSE is that they can be completely heterogeneous characteristics, for example, nodes may have multiple types of sensors, different power and processing capabilities and can interact with other network through a gateway.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Powerful devices can perform complex operations, but are more expensive and power-hungry consume much power.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Otherwise, weak WSN devices enable higher deployment densities and increase network lifetime as they are cheaper and consume less power.",,,,1,,,,,,
"By integrating devices with different resources and capabilities, a heterogeneous WSN can combine the advantages of both powerful and weak devices.",,,,1,,,,,,
The heterogeneity of the network presents significant challenges for service provisioning.,,,,0,,,,,,
New programming models are necessary to simplify WSN application development and increase overall network utility.,,,,1,,,,,,
Service-oriented computing can simplify application development by hiding platform- specific capabilities behind services.,,,,0,,,,,,
"These services are dynamically discovered and used at run-time, enabling applications to be platform-independent and adapt to network dynamics.",,,,1,,,,,,
"While service-oriented computing is widely used on the Internet, adopting it to WSNs is non-trivial due to the extremely limited resources available and highly dynamic nature.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Networks are systems that have a limited amount of resources.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Therefore, service provisioning in Sensor Networks is a huge challenge.",,,,1,,,,,,
The classical SOA-based approaches are not currently feasible to be used over Wireless Sensor Networks because of the intrinsic resource limitations of that kind of technologies.,,,,1,,,,,,
"The SOA standards such as XML, HTTP, SOAP, WSDL and UDDI are majorly related with web services provisioning by using no resources-constrained computers so they are not recommended to be applied in WSN.",,,,1,,,,,,
There are some proposals which try to solve the service provisioning in Wireless Sensor Networks by using SOA-based technology.,,,,0,,,,,,
In [42] an iterative SOA-based design process was proposed.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Services-oriented architecture suits particularly well for WSNs as the development of the whole network can directly be mapped to service, simple or complex.",,,,0,,,,,,
The proposed design process is based on agile design technologies [43].,,,,0,,,,,,
The authors of [42] chose this methodology since the WSN development is iterative and short what suits with the agile methods.,,,,1,,,,,,
"However, it is structured according a waterfall model [44].",,,,0,,,,,,
"The waterfall model includes eight stages: gathering of the requirements, their analysis, the design of the solution, development of the software architecture, development of the code, testing, deployment and post implementation.",,,,0,,,,,,
As it has been commented in previous section in [45] sensors and applications are modeled as services.,,,,0,,,,,,
This proposal includes a service discovery algorithm called context CASDA.,,,,0,,,,,,
This algorithm takes input as service request (SR) and available services (S).,,,,0,,,,,,
"For filtering purpose, only those services that belong to service requester category are managed.",,,,1,,,,,,
This algorithm returns degree of similarity between service request and available services.,,,,0,,,,,,
"To perform the comparison between requested and available service some factors are taken into account such service’s inputs and outputs, and required contextual information.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Fok in [46] proposed a middleware when the applications are implemented as task, which are platform-independent application processes that contain code, state, and service specifications.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Services are able to maintain state, provide multiple methods, and have their own thread of control, enabling them to operate in parallel with task.",,,,1,,,,,,
Servilla provides two light-weight programming languages tailored to support service provisioning in WSNs.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The first, ServillaSpec, is used to create service specifications and descriptions that enable flexible matching between tasks and services.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The second, ServillaScript, is used to create tasks and is compiled into bytecode that runs on a Virtual Machine.",,,,0,,,,,,
Services are implemented in NesC on TinyOS and compiled into native binary code for run-time efficiency.,,,,0,,,,,,
An important feature of Servilla lies in its capability to support coordination and collaboration among heterogeneous devices inside a WSN.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Wireless sensors networks, as the field of matures, needs support more complex applications and collaboration among them in order to provide services.",,,,1,,,,,,
"For this propose, it’s necessary more powerful programming methods, monitoring and control, both hardware and software, during its operation.",,,,1,,,,,,
Some solutions have been propose reprogramming sensor networks in the field.,,,,0,,,,,,
The ability of loading and updating applications after deployment is one of the factors that it will be the local sensor networks usable.,,,,0,,,,,,
Lately there have been some interesting proposals in this regards.,,,,0,,,,,,
"SensorScheme [47] is a platform for dynamic program loading and execution, based on the semantic of the Scheme programming language and designed to meet the demands of sensor networks applications.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This platform focused on efficient code transport, minimizing its size, by separating the format while transmitted from the in- memory code storage while executing, optimizing the communication channel and energy consumption.",,,,0,,,,,,
Interactive and Extensible Framework for Execution and Monitoring of Wireless Sensor Networks (ISEE) [48] is an environment for the execution and monitoring of sensor network services.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Is supports verification and testing of sensor network services, whether simulated, emulated or real.",,,,0,,,,,,
"So, this framework can be used during all process in wireless sensor network, development, deployment and real use.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This framework is based in previous work like EmStar [49] and TOSSIM [50], a simulator for TinyOs Networks.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Also, related whit this are the Virtual Sensor Networks.",,,,0,,,,,,
"They are a collaborative Wireless Sensor Networks to provide protocol support for the information, usage, adaptation and maintenance of subsets of sensors collaborating on specific tasks.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The main target is to enhance applications in which subsets of sensors, varying dynamically, must to achieve the desired outcomes, while relying on the remaining nodes connectivity, deployment and resources constrains.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Now, the objective is to get an execution environment that it allows to configure dynamically a service.",,,,0,,,,,,
"But, usually, a service shall consist of a group of applications that, using a collaborative way among then, they will provide a service.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Therefore, it’s necessary to develop an environment that configures each application and the relation with the others applications that provide the service.",,,,1,,,,,,
The function of Wireless Sensor Network Management Systems is to provide monitoring and controlling capabilities functionalities.,,,,0,,,,,,
"This kind of ubiquitous networks presents several peculiarities that make more difficult the management task performing over them, where can be identified open issues like the constrained- resources of nodes, dynamic network topology, variable channel capacity and prone to fail [51].",,,,0,,,,,,
"Due these limitations, main efforts in management procedures for sensor networks are mainly focused on monitoring and controlling tasks, in order to optimize the network operation and maintain the network performance [52].",,,,1,,,,,,
The network management protocols and frameworks designed for Wireless Sensor Networks had take into account the properties of sensor nodes.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In next Subsection, foundations of main approaches for sensor networks management will be presented, classifying them into protocols and management frameworks.",,,,0,,,,,,
"RRP (Register mechanism Routing Protocol) [55] is a cluster-based mobile routing algorithm aimed to improve the network life-time, using for this a system’s load balancing schema, which defines a set of flooding-zones for the data forwarding decisions, in order to perform the data aggregation tasks.",,,,1,,,,,,
"RRP proposes a hierarchical deployment based on three area types: manufacturing, warehouse and service.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Acquisition of data is carry out in the manufacturing area, delivering the processed data to the warehouse and service area.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The main advantages of RRP are that zone flooding ensures low message overheads, and adjusting the size of flooding zone, it ensures high reliability.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The main lacks of RRP are that it requires a GPS device attached to the sensor nodes, in order to implement the zone-flooding protocol.",,,,1,,,,,,
SNMS (Sensor Network Management System) [56] is an interactive system for sensor network health monitoring.,,,,0,,,,,,
It provides a query-based network health and event logging functions.,,,,0,,,,,,
SNMS supports collection and dissemination of traffic patterns.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Collection traffic pattern is used to obtain health data from the network, while dissemination traffic pattern is used to distribute management messages, commands, and queries.",,,,0,,,,,,
"To achieve the previous exposed goals, SNMS develops a gathering tree to collect network health information, introducing a minimal impact on memory and network traffic.",,,,1,,,,,,
SNMS further minimizes energy consumption merging multiple queries into a single message.,,,,1,,,,,,
"On the other hand, SNMS network management function is limited to passive monitoring only, requiring human managers to submit queries and perform post-mortem analysis of management data.",,,,1,,,,,,
"WinMS (Wireless Network Management System) [57] proposes an adaptive policy- based sensor network management system, which provides self-management for network performance maintaining, adapting the network behavior according to the traffic conditions.",,,,0,,,,,,
"WinMS architecture defines a schedule-driven MAC protocol, to collect and disseminate management data, form and to the sensor nodes in a gathering tree.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Also, it implements a local network management scheme, providing autonomy for wireless sensor nodes to perform management functions, and a central network management scheme, to perform preventive and corrective maintenance.",,,,0,,,,,,
"It is worth nothing, however, that the initial setup cost for building the gathering tree is proportional to network density.",,,,0,,,,,,
BOSS (Bridge Of the SensorS) [58] defines a service discovery management approach for Wireless Sensor Networks.,,,,0,,,,,,
"It supports network state information retrieval from the Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network, including sensor node device description, the number of sensor nodes in the network, and the network topology.",,,,0,,,,,,
The localization service provides positioning information for each sensor node in the network.,,,,0,,,,,,
The synchronization service is focused for clock synchronization among sensor nodes in the network.,,,,0,,,,,,
The power management service offers support for checking remaining battery and changing the sensor’s operation mode.,,,,0,,,,,,
"On the other hand, BOSS requires human interaction to analyze the network states, taking management actions accordingly.",,,,1,,,,,,
"MANNA (Management Architecture for Wireless Sensor Networks) [59]is a policy- based management architecture designed for gathering dynamic management information, mapping it into sensor networks models, performing management functions and services based on wireless sensor network.",,,,0,,,,,,
"It defines the MANNA Network Management Protocol (MNMP), which is a light-weight protocol designed for management information exchange between management entities (i.e., cluster- heads, nodes and manager).",,,,0,,,,,,
"Some of the management procedures covered by MANNA are related with coverage area supervision, networking parameters configuration, network topology and connectivity discovery, energy map generation, maintenance, reducing the network overhead, packets collision, and energy consumption, turning off redundant nodes in the Wireless Sensor Network.",,,,0,,,,,,
"SSNs (sensor sub-networks), which contains sensor nodes of same type, in order to large, heterogeneous Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks.",,,,0,,,,,,
To interconnect different SSNs is proposed the use of gateways.,,,,1,,,,,,
"In addition, this approach proposes the use of MS (Management Stations), a laptop or a remote workstation, which is connected to the Internet, and where the network topology can be visualized.",,,,0,,,,,,
Multimedia Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs) can be considered as a specific application of WSNs.,,,,0,,,,,,
The benefit of using such architectures is the deployment and maintenance facility induced by the inherent plug-and-play and self-organized nature of wireless sensor networks.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Several academic organizations and corporations are working on the development of new devices, protocols and architectures for MWSNs.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Authors of [61] give an extensive overview of the existing algorithms, software and hardware for multimedia wireless sensor networks.",,,,0,,,,,,
Yale University has developed SOS [64] an operating system that employs video sensor for behaviour interpretation using distributed sensing.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Georgia Institute heterogeneous sensors (scalar, low-res cameras, high-res cameras) for different studies at the MAC, Network, Transport and the Application layers.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Event-centric wireless sensor networks (EC-WSNs) differ from common WSNs, where the communications are triggered either by an on-demand or a sink-based process.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Indeed, in this case, the communication is triggered only when an event is detected in the immediate sensing-range of a node.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Final users, i.e. users interested in an event occurrence, can subscribe to one or more event interest, and get updates from the sensor network.",,,,0,,,,,,
"For example, clients (digital billboards, cell phone, laptops, PDA) interested in parking spots availability in a specific area may subscribe to this service and get updates each time the sensor network detects that places are available.",,,,0,,,,,,
The intent is to provide a pseudo real-time view of all the occurring events of the network.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Examples of application of EC-WSNs can be envisioned in urban environment, where final users may connect to a large scale EC-WSN and subscribe to various event-interests like: parking lots or public bikes availability, queues and lines status in different offices (postal office, supermarkets, fuel stations, etc.",,,,0,,,,,,
"A wireless sensor network is vulnerable due to its characteristics as an open medium, with a network topology that dynamically changes, which employs cooperative algorithms, it lacks an element for managing and monitoring the network and it also hasn’t a perimeter defence [66][68][70] clearly defined.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The main vulnerabilities in wireless sensor networks are [67][69]: wireless links, auto unattended operation.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The security problems in a wireless sensor networks become clear with the assumption that radio links are insecure, which makes communication in wireless sensor networks insecure too.",,,,1,,,,,,
"An attacker could easily listen to the channel as it is a broadcasting one, inject whatever data, and even play some bit packet headers that were sent before.",,,,0,,,,,,
"In addition, an attacker could gain control of one or more motes and attack from them the whole sensor network.",,,,0,,,,,,
Attacks on wireless sensor networks can be made from outside the network or can be originated inside it.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Attacks from malicious motes that are not part of the network and try to join it without authorization, are often done applying cryptanalysis techniques and attacking physically the device.",,,,1,,,,,,
Motes are part of the network and they may attack if they have been compromised by an attacker that has manipulated them [66].,,,,1,,,,,,
"The most common attacks that often occur in motes that are part of the network are: flood, alteration or replications of routing information, selective transmission, sink attack, Sybil attack, wormhole attack, HELLO flood attack, spoofing recognition, passive listening, denial of service and subversion of a node.",,,,0,,,,,,
Security in wireless sensor networks is currently provided exclusively through symmetric key cryptography but there is some studies which purpose ultra-low power hardware implementations of public key algorithms.,,,,0,,,,,,
Several public key schemes can be used to provide the security services described above.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In [6] we take a closer look at Rabin’s Scheme, NtruEncrypt and Elliptic Curve implementations.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Although these algorithms are more powerful and secure than those of symmetric key, we must take into account the time they take to encrypt and decrypt, the number of bits to be added when we encrypt a message and the energy consumption are much higher than that of symmetric key algorithms.",,,,0,,,,,,
"RC5 (Rivest Cipher-5) is an encryption block algorithm [73], which may be one of the cryptographic algorithms more suitable for WSN due to their good behavior in devices with low memory capacity.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Although RC6 is an algorithm with a security level something greater than RC5, it performance is significantly lower in WSN [74].",,,,0,,,,,,
"Another important algorithm used in Wireless Sensor Networks is TEA [75] (Tiny Encryption Algorithm), TEA is a block cipher algorithm which requires little memory space.",,,,0,,,,,,
"XTEA (eXtended TEA) is a block cipher algorithm, which appeared to correct the weaknesses of TEA.",,,,0,,,,,,
It was designed by engineers at Cambridge Computer Laboratory in 1997 and it has not been patent yet [76].,,,,0,,,,,,
The small size of the implementation of this algorithm has provided an option that is highly recommended on systems with very high memory restrictions (such as embedded systems or wireless sensor networks).,,,,0,,,,,,
"Some studies [77], concluding that the memory requirements imposed by XTEA in sensor networks are a quarter of those required by AES (Advanced Encryption System).",,,,,0,,,,,
"Thus also studies made by our researchers [78], has been shown that the use of the AES algorithm reduces half the batteries life.",,,,,1,,,,,
The traditional DES (Data Encryption Standard) uses many computational resources and therefore it isn’t recommended [79] for use in WSN.,,,,,1,,,,,
TinyECC and WMECC [80] are two implementations of public key cryptography on the TinyOS operating system.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Both include cryptographic primitives based in elliptic curve cryptography optimized for wireless sensor networks, such as models Micaz, Telosb and Imote2.",,,,,0,,,,,
"One of the greatest advantages is that the primitives are already included a specific operating system for wireless sensor networks, allowing developers use this type of primitive easily.",,,,,1,,,,,
TinyECC and WMECC perform for the first time deployments based in public key cryptography and introduce the concept of digital signature in devices designed for use on WSN.,,,,,1,,,,,
"However, the main disadvantage of this type of cryptography, is the high run time (with temporary magnitude scales around a second) required for data encryption or for processing or verifying digital signatures.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The .NET Micro Framework Microsoft architecture [81] also included in version 2.0 a namespace (package or classes group) oriented to the security for very low capacity devices, as employees in wireless sensor networks.",,,,,0,,,,,
"This space name, named Microsoft.SPOT.Cryptography [82] incorporates two cryptographic algorithms, one based on symmetric key cryptography and the other based on public key cryptography.",,,,,0,,,,,
The symmetric key algorithm is XTEA in a version optimized for WSN.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Although cannot speak about a security model, .NET Micro Framework provides the necessary tools to create a complete security model.",,,,,1,,,,,
Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October and on the free movement of such data was the first document where confidentiality of communications was guaranteed.,,,,,0,,,,,
Directive 97/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December telecommunications sector translated the principles set out in Directive 95/46/EC into specific rules for the telecommunications sector.,,,,,0,,,,,
"In the case of public communications networks, specific legal, regulatory and technical provisions should be made in order to protect fundamental rights and freedoms of natural person.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Measures should be taken to prevent unauthorized access to communications in order to protect the confidentiality of communications, including both the contents and any data related to such communications, by means of public communications networks and public available electronic services.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In digital mobile networks, location data giving the geographic position of the terminal equipment of the mobile user are processed to enable the transmission of communications.",,,,,1,,,,,
"On 25 June 2008, the European Parliament's Standing Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs asked for measures to correct the European Commission's proposal to amend the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (called ePrivacy Directive).",,,,,1,,,,,
"Peter Hustinx, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), adopted, on 14 April, an Opinion on the European Commission's proposal amending, among others, the ePrivacy Directive.",,,,,0,,,,,
The EDPS basically supported the EC proposal giving a few recommendations such as the obligation to notify any breach of security not only from providers of public electronic communication services in public networks but also from providers of information society services which process sensitive personal data.,,,,,1,,,,,
"When the number of nodes in the WSN grows and new services more complex are implemented, it is necessary to include authentication and authorization services in order to verify the data source and to allow taking authorization decisions.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In a model of communication between two parties, the data authentication can use symmetric mechanisms.",,,,,1,,,,,
Sender and receiver share a secret key to generate and verify a MAC (Message Authentication Code) [72].,,,,,1,,,,,
MAC mechanisms can be integrated into a sensor network through the protocol family SPINS (Security Protocols in Networked Systems ) [84].,,,,,1,,,,,
This solution presents as advantage that only adds 6 bytes in the packet payload and the energy consumption is only the 20 % of the total energy use.,,,,,0,,,,,
A widely authentication method used in WSN is the Authentication broadcast.,,,,,0,,,,,
This authentication requires an asymmetric mechanism.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Unfortunately, the asymmetric communication rate and storage, as already mentioned in previous paragraphs.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The uTesla protocol solves this problem by introducing asymmetry through the delayed revelation of symmetric keys, allowing an efficient authentication broadcast scheme.",,,,,1,,,,,
However [85] explains that uTelsa is not suitable for the authentication traffic between nodes because it provides authentication delayed in time.,,,,,1,,,,,
"In this protocol generated keys are applyed to generate messages MAC sequentially, but are released with a delay once the packets are received.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Therefore, authors as [86], propose the replacement of the initial distribution unicast using broadcast-based techniques.",,,,,1,,,,,
We can found some researches about the way to provide entities authentication in hierarchical sensor networks.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The authors of [87] propose the use of a certificate called TESLA, which can be use by low capacity devices (such as WSN nodes) to provide entity authentication.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Its framework authenticates new nodes on the network, while supports trust relationships.",,,,,0,,,,,
The authors of [88] propose a scheme based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).,,,,,0,,,,,
The idea of this scheme is to use PKI (Public Key Infrastructure ).,,,,,0,,,,,
"In this solution, there is a base station placed in a safe environment with increased capabilities of processing and storage.",,,,,0,,,,,
This base station serves as CA (Certification Authority).,,,,,0,,,,,
A certificate of a legitimate user (U) is signed by the CA.,,,,,1,,,,,
This schema requires more processing on the encryption and signature verification as on the decryption and signature.,,,,,0,,,,,
The authors claim that the use of ECC is feasible in this type of networks.,,,,,0,,,,,
However it may cause a bottleneck process from the sensor nodes if there is excessive traffic on the network.,,,,,1,,,,,
A weakness of this protocol is that an attacker can gain false certificates and signatures.,,,,,0,,,,,
In addition DoS attacks could be received by continuous sending of certificates that exhaust the memory and the battery of these nodes.,,,,,0,,,,,
There is also the possibility of a source authentication system broadcast based on sending multiple messages MAC [89] called MultiMAC.,,,,,0,,,,,
"What is new in this mechanism is to provide a key distribution combinatorial and deterministic, providing authentication is implemented as a security component of TinyOS.",,,,,1,,,,,
This mechanism based on multiple MAC messages and requires that network nodes have a key ring.,,,,,1,,,,,
"To authenticate a message, the source node generate a list of MAC based on their keys, and added them to the message.",,,,,1,,,,,
The receiving node will verify the message based on the MAC that has generated using keys that are shared with the source node.,,,,,0,,,,,
To meet the WSN restrictions must be designing an appropriate key ring.,,,,,1,,,,,

Task 2.4 aims at providing savvy users the means to assemble and program hardware that can be used by end-users to customize their smart environment.,,,,,1,,,,,
This section will provide a brief survey on the existing Do-it-Yourself hardware platforms and identify the technical challenges that need to be addressed to simplify the exposure of DiY devices in the DiYSE platform.,,,,,1,,,,,
A list of existing devices that can be connected to DiYSE has been provided in section 2.1.,,,,,0,,,,,
This section describes a few illustrative examples of inexpensive and open hardware platforms with a strong community support that hobbyists can use to create their own DiY devices.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Just as widgets make GUIs easy to develop, Phidgets [1] (or physical widgets) are building blocks that make the new generation of physical user interfaces easy to develop.",,,,,0,,,,,
The “Phidgets Interface Kit” is a board powered and controlled by a computer’s USB port.,,,,,0,,,,,
It features a number of analog inputs and outputs to which different kinds of low cost sensors and actuators can easily be plugged.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The interaction with the “Phidgets” is done through very simple APIs, consistent across a large number of programming languages, ranging from Java to Microsoft Excel.",,,,,0,,,,,
Arduino is a simple open hardware design based on the Atmel AVR family of microcontrollers.,,,,,0,,,,,
"It can easily be programmed using Wiring, a simple programming language, and the associated Arduino IDE.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Arduino features add-on modules called “shields”, which allow to add preassembled circuits to the main board to control motors, add Ethernet, Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Standalone non-networked device: it can interact only through input and output sensors and actuators, not with other devices.",,,,,0,,,,,
An example is a “DiY mood lamp” that changes color randomly.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Computer peripheral: device is connected to a computer through serial, USB, or Bluetooth.",,,,,0,,,,,
"It is programmed to act as a slave of a program running in the computer, just like Phidgets (Bitlash [6] or Firmata [7] libraries are useful for this).",,,,,0,,,,,
A typical project using this approach is a computer-controlled railway model.,,,,,0,,,,,
This is the simplest communicating setup as all microcontrollers have at least a serial port.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The drawback is that in order to operate the device, the computer needs to be running.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Networked device: Arduino boards can participate in a network, either using Ethernet or ZigBee shields with the corresponding libraries.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In this set up, different Arduino-based devices can talk to each other, to computers in the LAN or even to servers on the Internet (a gateway is still required for ZigBee to IP bridging).",,,,,1,,,,,
This is the most interesting configuration for DiYSE as it enables interaction between the application creation environment and the devices.,,,,,1,,,,,
Extensive support for the usage of Arduino is available online or in the “Making things talk” book [8].,,,,,0,,,,,
A huge number of embedded devices today run *NIX-like operating systems such as GNU/Linux and are open or hacked so that they can run custom software.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Indeed, peripherals such as Phidgets can be attached thus turning them into IP ambient devices that can be placed in buildings, vehicles or outdoor, powered by AC, batteries or even solar panels.",,,,,1,,,,,
This section will focus on how to easily connect self-programmed or self-assembled devices to a common infrastructure so that they can be accessed from the DiYSE application creation environment.,,,,,1,,,,,
Non-networked devices or devices that communicate with each other without interacting with computers or IP networks at all (e.g. a WiiMote controlling an Arduino-based Bluetooth lamp) are out of the scope of the DiYSE project because of the lack of obvious means to link them to the DiYSE application creation environment.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Open or hacked Linux-powered devices, such as listed above.",,,,,0,,,,,
"In general, IP devices host servers exposing their built-in functions, either through TCP or UDP servers, HTTP servers (possibly using a RESTful resource model [11]), UPnP [12] or DPWS [13].",,,,,1,,,,,
"Often, they are open platforms where new functionalities can be implemented using Software Development Kits.",,,,,0,,,,,
"In that case, user-added functions should also be exposed as services in the network.",,,,,1,,,,,
"As IP devices, they can directly participate in network interactions without intermediaries, either on the local network or through the Internet.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Discovery: the device needs to be discovered, either through a dynamic lookup or in a directory.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Most dynamic discovery protocols, such as the ones used by Zeroconf, UPnP and DPWS, rely on multicast UDP datagrams, that don’t propagate outside a LAN without a proxy.",,,,,0,,,,,
UPnP and DPWS protocol stacks fully match the needs of plug-and-play IP devices and open-source tools enable the development of the service software for many embedded platforms.,,,,,1,,,,,
"However, the required effort make it more suited for industrial companies than for hobbyists.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Using an HTTP server (preferably using a RESTful resource model) is a good compromise, as HTTP servers are available in binary format for all kinds of IP devices and programming can be simply done through server-side scripts.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Description: in addition to discovery, the protocol enabling to control the device should be described or the software component enabling its usage (driver) made available in order to avoid users manually describing the interaction protocol.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Eventing: if devices are meant to receive commands and notify events, a callback mechanism should be implemented.",,,,,1,,,,,
"These devices will need a device-specific software “driver” running on the computer which will hide the specificities of the peripheral to the controlling application, which is independent of the underlying communication protocol.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Assuming that the semantics and coordination of the device interaction is ensured by the upper layers, the remaining challenge for a Do-it-Yourself usage of this category of devices is the seamless search and deployment of the appropriate device drivers.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In order to achieve a sense of interaction without computers, these peripherals can be connected to the one of the abovementioned embedded GNU/Linux-based computers, which can run permanently, silently and hidden.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In this case, a network service exposing the peripheral to remote user applications would be required.",,,,,1,,,,,
This category groups devices that communicate using networks that do not use full TCP/IP stacks.,,,,,1,,,,,
"As an example, an increasing number of hobbyists that want wireless battery-powered devices buy ready-to-use ZigBee modules [14].",,,,,1,,,,,
These modules are easy to use as they behave like simple modems (communication uses serial and configuration is done through Hayes AT commands).,,,,,1,,,,,
They form wireless networks with star or mesh topologies that self-configure and route messages.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Having a computer (“gateway”) run a program that controls the whole network, hides its underlying complexity and exposes it as a service or “virtual device”.",,,,,1,,,,,
The drawback is that this program would be usage-specific.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The advantage is the solution is simple to implement, as it is equivalent to exposing a peripheral.",,,,,1,,,,,
The state-of-the-art solution to implement this on top of low-power devices is headers on top of low-power devices (both wired and wireless).,,,,,0,,,,,
"In this case, the role of the gateway is solely to compress and uncompress the IPv6 headers.",,,,,1,,,,,
UDP and ICMP protocols are already supported in a number of devices.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The remaining issue is that running a TCP stack on such low-power devices, even if feasible, is over-engineering for its actual usage.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In the application layer, current works, such as 6lowAPP [16], propose the usage of simple protocols similar to REST.",,,,,0,,,,,
The development of such protocols and development libraries for non-experts remains a challenge to be addressed.,,,,,0,,,,,

This specification has been developed within UIC Project EIRENE.,,,,,0,,,,,
It specifies the functional requirements for a digital radio standard for the European railways and is part of the Technical Specification for Interoperability.,,,,,0,,,,,
The EIRENE Functional Requirements Specification defines the requirements of a radio system satisfying the mobile communications needs of the European railways1.,,,,,0,,,,,
"It encompasses ground-train voice and data communications, together with the ground- based mobile communications needs of trackside workers, station and depot staff and railway administrative and managerial personnel.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The scope of this specification is to provide interoperability for trains and staff crossing national or other borders between systems, and to provide manufacturing economies of scale wherever practical.",,,,,0,,,,,
The primary objective of this specification is to ensure interoperability along international lines which are generally high speed and cross suburban areas with a high level of traffic.,,,,,0,,,,,
It is also important for this specification to provide an appropriate standard for future replacement of national radio systems operating on both important internal routes and low to medium traffic rural areas.,,,,,0,,,,,
It will be determined on a national basis whether different classes of service need to be defined for such routes.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The EIRENE Functional Requirements Specification defines a set of requirements which a railway radio system should comply with, in order to facilitate international interoperability between national railways and manufacturing economies of scale.",,,,,1,,,,,
"This specification therefore defines the functional requirements, to ensure that core railway functionality is provided.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The specification distinguishes between the requirements affecting a railway’s network infrastructure, onto which mobiles will roam, and the requirements concerning mobiles which will be used in any EIRENE-compliant network.",,,,,0,,,,,
The statements made in the specification are assigned to one of three categories: - Mandatory (indicated by ‘(M)’ at the end of the paragraph).,,,,,0,,,,,
It is mandatory that each railway meets these specifications on lines where interoperability is required.,,,,,1,,,,,
The mandatory requirements define the full set of interoperability requirements for EIRENE systems.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Optional requirements are not mandatory for interoperability and, as such, the selection (or non-selection) of a set of optional requirements on a national basis shall not be used as a precondition for the certification and the acceptance of roaming mobile equipment on GSM-R networks.",,,,,1,,,,,

Either the lead driver calls the controller or the controller calls the lead driver.,,,,,0,,,,,
"In the latter case, the controller is automatically added into the multi- driver call.",,,,,1,,,,,
Functional identity of the controller shall be displayed in the leading cab.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Not more than 2 MMI actions should be necessary to switch between groups, i.e. to leave one group and to subscribe to another group, excluding the operations necessary to select the required group from a list or enter digits.",,,,,1,,,,,
This shall be carried out by entering the train number (option 1 in 5.2.3.26).,,,,,0,,,,,
The radio equipment that will be mounted in rolling stock can be split into two classes: in-cab equipment and external equipment.,,,,,0,,,,,
Each type of equipment has slightly different requirements placed upon it in terms of EMC and climate.,,,,,0,,,,,
Ease of maintenance should be taken into account in the design and installation of radio equipment.,,,,,0,,,,,

"For activation, a maximum of 2 MMI actions should be allowed.",,,,,1,,,,,
"These may be physically separate or co- located; however, the majority of interaction is with the primary controller.",,,,,0,,,,,
Detailed specification of controller equipment and the interface between such equipment and the EIRENE network is at the discretion of the railway operator.,,,,,0,,,,,
The primary controller’s MMI should provide the following functionality: (O) - Queue all incoming calls or call requests.,,,,,0,,,,,
Emergency calls should be identified and presented at the top of the queue followed by calls in order of their priority.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The functionality required by other types of controllers is essentially the same as for primary controllers, but the control area will differ and the call set-up subsystem may be integrated into their own function management system.",,,,,0,,,,,
"At the detailed level, different controllers may have specific addressing needs, eg catering controllers will need to call specific vehicles in a train.",,,,,1,,,,,
The communications architecture will be dictated by local circumstances.,,,,,0,,,,,
The definition of this interface is beyond the scope of EIRENE.,,,,,0,,,,,
International standardisation of numbering plans is needed to ensure interworking between networks.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Furthermore, standardised allocation of numbers to subscribers will facilitate schemes for identification, barring, etc.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Telephone numbers can be defined on a national basis, but codes for certain functions shall be used on an international basis in order to allow interoperability.",,,,,1,,,,,
"For certain functions, standardised telephone numbers shall be implemented.",,,,,1,,,,,
"To provide interoperability between the fixed railway networks within the EIRENE network, standardisation of UIC group numbering will be required.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In the case where an EIRENE mobile attempts to make a Railway emergency call over a public network, the ability to pre-empt lower priority calls (particularly public emergency calls) may be inhibited, unless a special agreement is in place.",,,,,1,,,,,
Shaded cells on the access matrix mean that this call is outside the scope of the EIRENE specifications.,,,,,0,,,,,
"If required, a railway may make additional restrictions to the access matrix.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Examples include EIRENE mobiles, controller terminals, railway fixed network telephones and public telephones.",,,,,0,,,,,
"During this recovery period, the system shall not permit the use of unverified functional numbers.",,,,,1,,,,,

This facility is required principally for the safe conduct of pushing manoeuvres to assure continuing availability of the radio channel while a shunting worker is guiding a train driver.,,,,,1,,,,,
It is possible for a controller to be a member of several group calls simultaneously.,,,,,0,,,,,
The controller can actively participate in only one of these calls at any time.,,,,,0,,,,,
Each type of equipment has slightly different requirements placed upon it in terms of EMC and climate (UIC fiche 6515 is a useful reference concerning the layout of cab equipment).,,,,,0,,,,,
"Copyright This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant Unless officially marked PUBLIC, this document and its contents remain the property of the beneficiaries of the WYRED Consortium and may not be distributed or reproduced without the express approval of the Project Coordinator.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The requirements document is created in the first steps of the project for getting a wide vision about what kind of data, users and functionalities are going to be presented in WYRED the project (García- Peñalvo, 2016; García-Peñalvo & Kearney, 2016).",,,,,0,,,,,
"This document also represents a guide for the developing process, because it informs about the priority of the tasks, the dependencies among the tasks and the information they require, including the background, objectives, and targets too.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In the process of the requirements definition, we can use different approaches depending on the software methodology.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In this case, we chose the Durán and Bernárdez (2002) methodology because it offers a simple, but powerful, process to elicit and document the requirements.",,,,,1,,,,,
"This methodology is based on tables, where we fill the information about a specific requirement.",,,,,1,,,,,
The project requirements represent properties that our project is going to have.,,,,,0,,,,,
"However, there are properties about different things (functionalities, design, information, etc.).",,,,,0,,,,,
"In our methodology, the authors defined three types of requirements.",,,,,1,,,,,
This type of requirement groups all requirements about the information that the system is going to manage.,,,,,0,,,,,
There is very important to set these requirements in order to develop the system that is going to manage the data.,,,,,1,,,,,
"In WYRED one of the most important thing is to maximize the users’ privacy, due to this we are going to split the user’s information between public and private in the platform.",,,,,1,,,,,
This information was selected with ours partners to keep the minimum information required to develop a correct social dialogue.,,,,,1,,,,,
"These fields are the nickname (Table 1: NicknameTable 1), the language (Table 2), the avatar image (Table 3), the area (Table 4) and the topics of interest (Table 5).",,,,,0,,,,,
The platform also has to manage more information about its users due to this can help us to extract patterns and get conclusions.,,,,,1,,,,,
"However, this information will be private and nobody will see the private information of a specific user.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Therefore, it will be treated anonymously in order to respect the users’ privacy.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The information that we keep private is: the name (Table 6), the surname (Table 7), the country (Table , the city (Table 9), the sex (Table 10), the age (birth date) (Table 11), the education level (Table 12) and the email (Table 13).",,,,,0,,,,,
The main problem to manage documents is that there are many formats that we have to support and they use many resources.,,,,,0,,,,,
"For this reason, we decided keeping them in a dedicate server to improve the platform performance.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The statistics save data about the number of publications for each user, her time in the platform, how many pages she has visited, in how many projects she is involved, etc.",,,,,0,,,,,
The both requirements are described in Table 14 and Table 15 respectively.,,,,,0,,,,,
"This type of requirements groups all requirements about what kind of technologies we are going to use, and regarding the platform design and architecture too.",,,,,0,,,,,
"When we planned how to design a platform for youth people, we checked that they use more their mobiles than other classic devices such as laptops or desktops.",,,,,1,,,,,
"For this reason, we decided to use a responsive design that can work well in all kinds of devices.",,,,,1,,,,,
"However, creating a platform where our users are going to use mainly mobiles has other problem, the performance.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Usually mobiles have wireless connections and depending on the country, they can be a bit slow, so we add a requirement about the platform performance.",,,,,1,,,,,
The both requirements are described in Table 16 and Table 17 respectively.,,,,,0,,,,,
"We also would like to develop a mobile application for the more common mobile systems (Android and iOS), in order to get a better response from the user.",,,,,1,,,,,
"However, this requirement is more a wish than a urgent necessity and for this reason, it will have a minor priority.",,,,,0,,,,,
One of the objectives of WYRED is to develop a platform without spend money in non-relevant functions.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Due to this, we have planned to use Linux servers and free technologies.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Linux servers are cheaper than Windows servers and offer a solid base to develop a complete web platform, in the same way, there are free technologies/software such as PHP or MySQL that are widely used in web development and we can use them without a specific cost.",,,,,0,,,,,
These requirements are described in Table 19 and Table 20 respectively.,,,,,0,,,,,
"One of the most important objectives is to keep all content in the platform hidden for public users, because we are working, in some cases, with underage people.",,,,,1,,,,,
"So, the platform content does not have to be indexed.",,,,,0,,,,,
This kind of requirements is related to the functions that the system has to support.,,,,,0,,,,,
One of the aspect related to the privacy is how to keep the users’ information private and avoid arguments in the platform.,,,,,0,,,,,
The solution that we have planned is to use an automatic system that checks all messages looking for a list of alert words.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Although the intelligent system can find messages with alert words, these should be checked manually, for this reason we are going to develop a group of moderation tools for editing, deleting, moving, etc.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Moreover, we will put an option where the users can inform a moderator that there is a message that should be analyze.",,,,,1,,,,,
"These requirements are in Table 22, Table 23, and Table 24.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The objective of WYRED is that the youth people can interact themselves and speak things that are important for them, in some cases, they also can offer solutions for their own problems.",,,,,0,,,,,
"For this reason, we have to allow that a user can register in WYRED.",,,,,1,,,,,
"However, WYRED is not a chat but a platform where there should exist a structured social dialogue, so we are going to develop something like forum topics.",,,,,1,,,,,
This system helps the users answer questions and create discussion threads with their comments.,,,,,0,,,,,
"With the objective of having a good response, first of all, the users will fill a form where they can say in which things they are interested in.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Therefore, a researcher or a user will create a project, this will be hidden for all that are not invited to participate; for achieving this, the creator will select what kind of users are going to be invited using the public user’s information.",,,,,1,,,,,
This process is described with the following requirements from Table 25 to Table 30.,,,,,0,,,,,
One of the key elements to attracting young people is working on functionalities that improve the users’ engagement.,,,,,0,,,,,
"This helps to improve a lot of metrics such as page views, used time and social sharing.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The first requirement, which we have defined with this aim, was a translation system due to there are users from countries that speak different languages.",,,,,1,,,,,
"We have also thought that it would be interesting to use a gamification system to increase the users’ engagement, due to it is one of the most common technique used right now.",,,,,1,,,,,
"For improving the usability, we have planned to design custom styles for each age group, because of teenagers do not want to use a childish platform.",,,,,1,,,,,
"We have also kept in mind that if a user likes our platform, she would like to share it with her friends, for this reason, we will develop an easy tool for social sharing.",,,,,1,,,,,
"These requirements are described in tables: Table 31, Table 32, Table 33 and Table 34.",,,,,0,,,,,
"In the social dialogue process, the researchers need to work with many kind of documents, such as text, audio, images and video.",,,,,1,,,,,
"These documents are a relevant part in the WYRED project, so we have planned to develop tools for showing and sharing them.",,,,,1,,,,,
The researchers also suggest that they need an online editor and an easy way for adding annotation in audio and video files.,,,,,0,,,,,
"These requirements are described in tables: Table 35, Table 36 and Table 37.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The researchers are also an important part of the WYRED project, for this reason, they are going to have a private zone.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In this zone, they will be able to monitor their own social dialogues, share information between the project researchers and analyze their data.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In order to improve the data analysis process, we are going to develop visualization tools and a pattern matching system.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The visualization tools will help the researchers to discover knowledge using charts, trees and other representations.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The pattern matching system will use techniques such as datamining or natural language processing, in order to give to the researchers some patterns about the stored data.",,,,,1,,,,,
"These requirements are described in tables: Table 38, Table 39 and Table 40.",,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall store the information corresponding to the user's nickname.,,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall store the information corresponding to the languages that each user can use in the platform.,,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall store the information corresponding to the user's avatar (a public image that represents him).,,,,,0,,,,,
We will offer a catalogue of avatars and the users will choose one of them.,,,,,0,,,,,
"If we can, it would be good has a system to personalize the avatar.",,,,,1,,,,,
The system shall store the information corresponding to the user's localization.,,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall store the information corresponding to the main topics of interest for each user.,,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall store the information corresponding to the user's name.,,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall store the information corresponding to the user's surname.,,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall store the information corresponding to the user's country.,,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall store the information corresponding to the city where the user lives.,,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall store the information corresponding to the user's gender.,,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall store the information corresponding to the user's age (based on the birth date).,,,,,0,,,,,
"The best approach to manage age is to create group of ages, for example teens, kids, etc.",,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall store the information corresponding to the user's education level.,,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall store the information corresponding to the user's mail.,,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall store the information corresponding to platform usage statistics.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The system shall have a multi-platform native approach, for this reason we should create an application for the most important mobile operating system (Android and iOS).",,,,,1,,,,,
"The system shall keep all content hidden for public users, browsers, etc.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The system shall have moderation tools to allow moderators edit, move and delete messages.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The system shall have an intelligent system to check a list of ""alerts"" words.",,,,,1,,,,,
We have to define what fields are needed in the register process.,,,,,0,,,,,
The topics system must support that a user cite other user/users answer.,,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall support selecting what kind of visibility we want for each part of the system.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The allowed options are public, restricted by user or private.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The system shall have an option where the researcher can select what kind of users he needs in his research, using the public profile fields.",,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall have the possibility that a user can create a project and invite other users to join him.,,,,,0,,,,,
The project has to have a zone where the users can speak and interact.,,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall use an automatic translation system such as Google translator in order to allow the communication between people who speaks different languages.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The system shall have an option to insert videos, audios, documents and other stuff.",,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall have an online editor for documents.,,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall have a system that allows annotation in video and audio files.,,,,,1,,,,,
The system shall have monitoring tools in the researcher zone in order to see the social dialogue evolution.,,,,,1,,,,,
"These tools should use the number of participants, their interactions, the number of comments, the number of uploaded documents, etc.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The system shall have a powerful visualization system, that displays the statistics in graphs, charts, trees and other representations.",,,,,0,,,,,
The aim of this system is helping the researcher to understand the data.,,,,,0,,,,,
The system shall have a system that can analyse the data and find patterns automatically.,,,,,0,,,,,
"This system can use multiple approach like NLP (Natural Language Processing), datamining, etc.",,,,,0,,,,,

"In 2011, after a meeting of the Space Science Advisory Committee, the M3 candidate missions for the Cosmic-Vision 2015-2025 programme were selected for further assessment and consideration for launch in the early 2020’s.",,,,,1,,,,,
The MarcoPolo-R Near-Earth Asteroid sample return mission was selected as one of the M-class candidate missions.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The nominal launch date for M-class missions is now 2024, but the missions shall also be compatible with opportunities in 2022.",,,,,0,,,,,
During the fall 2011 the mission concept was studied in the Concurrent Design Facility at ESTEC (internal pre-assessment) in order to prepare a thorough industrial assessment phase.,,,,,1,,,,,
The purpose of the ongoing assessment phase is to assess the feasibility of this mission.,,,,,1,,,,,
"After the assessment phase ending in 2013, one M-class mission will be selected.",,,,,1,,,,,
"If adopted, the mission would proceed into definition and implementation (Phases B1/B2/C/D).",,,,,1,,,,,
"In parallel with the system level activities, an Announcement of Opportunity will be issued calling for the provision of scientific instruments by the science community through ESA.",,,,,1,,,,,
It is anticipated that the selection of the science instruments will be confirmed by February 2013.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Currently, references to the payload point to the Payload Resources and Requirements Document (PRRD, [RD16]).",,,,,0,,,,,
"After the payload for MarcoPolo-R is selected, this will be replaced by individual Experiment Interface Documents – Part B (EID-B) for each instrument.",,,,,1,,,,,
The overall mission development planning is shown in the figure below.,,,,,0,,,,,
The dates and various activities are indicative only.,,,,,0,,,,,
The planning will be updated following the assessment phase and the Contractor shall provide its own bottom-up development schedule.,,,,,1,,,,,
This is a Mission Requirements Document (MRD) to be used as an Applicable Document in the MarcoPolo-R industrial assessment study.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The purpose of the MRD is to provide all high-level mission-level requirements (including S/C and payload, launcher, ground segment and operations) necessary to achieve the science goals detailed in [AD2] for the MarcoPolo-R industrial system design studies running through 2012/2013.",,,,,1,,,,,
It includes functional and performance requirements down to the sub-system level which can be defined at this stage.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Later on in the course of the definition phase, it will result into two self-standing documents, i.e. the Mission Requirements Document and the System Requirements Document.",,,,,1,,,,,
Recording and tracking of changes as well as giving a brief rationale is very important.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The traceability of the requirements is paramount in order to make this document and its associated requirements easy to read and to understand at any stage of the mission assessment and possibly later definition phase, should this mission be selected.",,,,,1,,,,,
It has been updated after the baseline selection review in the course of the assessment phase.,,,,,0,,,,,
It will be reviewed as part of the assessment phase and will be updated following the Preliminary Requirement Review at the end of 2013.,,,,,1,,,,,
The mission requirements document is one of the documents that constitute the foundations of the mission profile for MarcoPolo-R.,,,,,0,,,,,
The mission document tree is given here below for information and lists the envisaged documentation (to be confirmed) available by the time of the Preliminary Requirements Review.,,,,,0,,,,,
This issue of the Mission Requirements Document has been established in support of the Industrial Studies of the system design of the MarcoPolo-R mission.,,,,,0,,,,,
The document is (currently) an open document and regular updates are expected.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Particularly, iterative steps with industrial or internal study partners and the ESA study manager are foreseen.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Revisions will be published, as required, at the start of, as well as during the system design.",,,,,1,,,,,
The book captain of this document is the MarcoPolo-R study manager and any comment on this document should be directly reported to him.,,,,,0,,,,,
Any conflict between requirements in this document shall be reported to ESA and any modification requires his/her prior approval.,,,,,1,,,,,
Items included in this MRD are classified according to the following categories.,,,,,0,,,,,
"If not complied with, the Agency shall immediately be notified.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Their impact on the mission technical complexity and programmatic aspects (e.g. cost, risk) shall be limited so as to stay within the M-class boundaries.",,,,,0,,,,,
Goals may be fulfilled under limited favourable conditions.,,,,,1,,,,,
They are highlighted in italic in order to be easily identified.,,,,,1,,,,,
Such an explanation can be found in italic below the requirement itself.,,,,,0,,,,,
This is intended only to assist the understanding of the requirement or its origin (the Parent requirement ID might be sometimes included wherever applicable).,,,,,1,,,,,
"Should a requirement be deleted in a later update of this document, its number will not be reused and should a requirement be introduced in between other requirements, the last digit will be used (e.g. R-YYY-115 between R-YYY-110 and R-YYY-120).",,,,,1,,,,,
"This paragraph describes the baseline MarcoPolo-R system and its mission profile selected at the Baseline Selection Review of the assessment phase in June 2012, in consultation with the European Science Study Team, the industrial teams and through an ESA internal review process.",,,,,0,,,,,
The system breakdown is defined in the diagram below.,,,,,0,,,,,
MarcoPolo-R is a sample return mission to the primitive Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) 1996 FG3 which is a binary system.,,,,,0,,,,,
"A spacecraft composite made of a main spacecraft, also called the sampling spacecraft and carrying the Earth re-entry capsule (ERC), will be launched by a Soyuz- Fregat MT 2-1b launch vehicle from Kourou on a direct escape trajectory to 1996 JU3.",,,,,0,,,,,
The mission design and its development needs to be compatible with launch opportunities from launch slots between 2022 and 2025 have been identified with relevant backup opportunities and are all described in [RD1].,,,,,0,,,,,
"Mission transfers, swing-bys and associated dates and duration slightly vary across the various opportunities.",,,,,0,,,,,
The reader will refer to [RD1] for the full analysis and the requirements in this document refer to the most demanding case for each parameter.,,,,,,0,,,,
"After one Venus Swing-by in October 2024, the spacecraft rendezvous with the NEA in February 2026.",,,,,,0,,,,
In the 2022 scenario the proximity operations last for ~ 190 days (but for other opportunities it ranges from 180 through 390 days).,,,,,,0,,,,
The proximity/science operations are described in 2.1.4.,,,,,,0,,,,
"In a nutshell, this phase will include instrument calibration, far and close observations of the binary system with the various science instruments, gravity field determination and hazard mapping above roughly 5 km altitude.",,,,,,0,,,,
Five sampling site candidates are then characterized at high resolution at about 250 m (TBC) distance to the surface during a few minutes in order to determine the most suitable sampling site (i.e. yielding the best compromise between science return and risk-mitigation).,,,,,,0,,,,
"After one successful sampling rehearsal, the spacecraft, which will be designed to cope with surface hazards (e.g. large clearance to the surface), navigates towards the finally selected touchdown/sampling site and collects hundreds of g of surface material.",,,,,,1,,,,
The sampling strategy is based on a touch and go approach to lower cost and risk.,,,,,,0,,,,
Therefore the spacecraft performs a soft touchdown of the surface for a few seconds (in the order of 2-5 seconds) and then takes-off immediately after that to move into a safe position away from the surface.,,,,,,1,,,,
"If it is confirmed, via a reliable verification technique, that a scientifically meaningful sample has been collected, the sample is transferred to the re-entry capsule and sealed.",,,,,,1,,,,
The spacecraft is then ready for departure back to Earth or can carry on orbital science if desired.,,,,,,1,,,,
"If the sampling operation was not successful, the spacecraft can undertake 2 more attempts (3 attempts in total).",,,,,,1,,,,
The spacecraft departs from the asteroid in August 2026 and returns to Earth in April 2029 after one Venus swing-by in November 2027.,,,,,,1,,,,
The re-entry capsule is then released and undertakes a high-speed Earth re-entry at Ventry of maximum ~ 13 km.s-1 (in other scenarios the re-entry velocity is lower ~ 11-12.6 km.s-1).,,,,,,1,,,,

Issue 2 of the document has a large number of changes.,,,,,,0,,,,
This document records the scientific requirements for the Large Observatory for X-ray Timing (LOFT).,,,,,,0,,,,
These are the reference requirements through which the Mission Requirements Document will be derived and also the instrument specifications are deduced.,,,,,,0,,,,
The document starts with the mission statement (also called level 0 requirements) and the minimum scientific success criteria.,,,,,,0,,,,
Next these goals are quantified in a number of sub-goals (level 1 requirements).,,,,,,0,,,,
"These level 1 requirements translate into requirements for the two instruments, the mission and the observation plan (level 2 requirements).",,,,,,0,,,,
"Although the level 2b and 2c could be omitted we have included them as they define rather well the type of mission needed to optimize the science (and, for example, level 2c requirements follow a science judgement and cannot be derived from the top level requirements).",,,,,,0,,,,
"The structure of the document is as follows: first the top level objectives and science requirements are given (levels 0 and 1, see section 4).",,,,,,0,,,,
"Next the requirements for the two instruments are presented, including a detailed justification and specification of the requirements.",,,,,,0,,,,
"These are, for a significant fraction, based on the observation plan given in section 7.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Detailed description of dependencies in the requirements is presented in appendix A, showing that there is a safe margin in the key requirements with respect to achieving the science goals.",,,,,,0,,,,
"In appendix B we provide an overview of the requirement flow down, in appendix C we provide some information about requirements which have been dropped and in appendix D we provide a detailed justification for the required energy resolution.",,,,,,0,,,,
This version 2 of the science requirements document has relatively few substantial changes in the numbered requirements compared with the issue 1.6.,,,,,,0,,,,
It has however been restructured to meet the request from ESA to provide a more rigorous flow down of the requirements.,,,,,,0,,,,
Only the substantial changes are listed in the change log.,,,,,,0,,,,

LOFT is designed to study the equation of state of ultra-dense matter and to explore the conditions of strong-field gravity.,,,,,,0,,,,
EOS of ultra-dense matter and neutron star structure.,,,,,,0,,,,
Understanding the properties of ultra-dense matter and determining its equation of state (EOS) is one of the most challenging problems in contemporary physics.,,,,,,0,,,,
"At densities exceeding that of atomic nuclei, exotic states of matter such as Bose condensates or hyperons may appear; a phase transition to strange quark matter may take place at higher densities.",,,,,,0,,,,
Only neutron stars probe these densities in the ‘zero’ temperature regime relevant to these transitions.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Very “soft” EOSs give a maximum neutron star mass in the 1.4-1.5 solar mass (Mo) range, whereas “stiff” EOSs can reach up to 2.4 -2.5 Mo before collapse to a black hole becomes unavoidable.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Apart from maximum mass, the relation between the neutron star mass and radius (M-R) is a powerful probe of the EOS.",,,,,,0,,,,
"With the exception of redshifts of any narrow atmospheric lines (feasible for slowly rotating stars only), all tools devised to constraint mass-radius are based primarily on accurate time-resolved and high-throughput broadband spectral measurements.",,,,,,0,,,,
"In ~25 neutron stars, spins are now observed in burst oscillations and/or coherent pulsations at frequencies of up to 620 Hz, proving that millisecond spins and dynamically relevant magnetic fields are common among neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries.",,,,,,0,,,,
"LOFT will measure the masses and radii of thermonuclear powered millisecond pulsars to an instrumental accuracy of of 4% in mass and 3% in radius by modelling their pulse profiles: their fast spin and strong gravity affect the radiation from the surface hot spots producing the pulsations through relativistic beaming, time dilation, red/blue-shifts, light bending and frame dragging (hence they provide an alternative probe of strong field gravity effects as well).",,,,,,0,,,,
LOFT will be able to cross-validate these results by flux and spectral modelling at photospheric touch-down of radius-expansion thermonuclear X-ray bursts.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Since the maximum rotation a neutron star can sustain depends on its mass and structure, fastest spin periods also constraint the neutron star EOS.",,,,,,0,,,,
LOFT will detect periodic signals (and QPOs as well) with unprecedented sensitivity.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Models indicate that the pulsation amplitude in fast spinning neutron stars in X-ray binaries could be as low as 0.1%, so the effective area of the LAD is needed to detect these pulsations in a typical 104 s observation of a over short periods of time, indicate that it should be possible to build up a much better spin period distribution for accreting neutron stars than has been possible with RXTE.",,,,,,0,,,,
"These intermittent pulsations were also very hard, underscoring the need for a timing mission with a good hard X-ray response.",,,,,,0,,,,
LAD can search for them with an unprecedented sensitivity (0.4 % amplitude in 100s for 100mCrab source).,,,,,,0,,,,
A different approach has recently emerged from the discovery of global seismic oscillations GSOs) in the tens of Hz to kHz range from magnetars during the rare and extremely luminous giant flares emitted by these sources.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The lower frequency GSOs likely arise from torsional shear oscillations of the crust and their frequency, in combination with the magnetic field inferred from the magnetar spin-down, tightly constrains the EOS.",,,,,,0,,,,
"LOFT has the capability detect and study GSOs for the first time in ‘intermediate’ flares, which are tens of times more frequent than giant ones, down to amplitudes of 0.7%, an order of magnitude lower than seen up to now.",,,,,,0,,,,
This will open a new window in the study of neutron star structure through astero- seismology.,,,,,,0,,,,
The equation of state of ultra-dense matter will be quantified using neutron star mass and radius measurements and measurements tailored to neutron star crust properties.,,,,,,0,,,,
"About 40 compact objects accreting matter in binaries are now known to display variability arising in, and occurring at the (millisecond) dynamical timescale of their inner accretion flows: black holes and neutron stars, respectively, show QPOs of up to 450 and 1250 Hz.",,,,,,0,,,,
"These QPOs require an explanation that involves the fundamental frequencies of the motion of matter in the inner, strong-field gravity-dominated disk regions.",,,,,,0,,,,
"In the absence of sufficient guidance from observations, modelling has so far been to a large extent phenomenological, and different interpretations are still viable.",,,,,,0,,,,
"For example, competing models variously identify observed QPOs with the relativistic radial and vertical epi- cyclic frequencies or relativistic nodal and periastron precession.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Very high-signal-to-noise LOFT/LAD measurements of the QPOs will unambiguously discriminate between such interpretations and in the process tease out as yet untested general relativistic effects such as frame dragging, strong-field periastron precession, and the presence of an innermost stable orbit.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Crucially, LOFT will provide access for the first time to types of information in these signals that are qualitatively new due to the capability to measure dynamical timescale phenomena within their coherence time, where so far only statistical averages of signals were accessible.",,,,,,0,,,,
This will allow studies that directly witness QPO formation and propagation and tie in with phenomena that state-of-the-art numerical work is just beginning to address.,,,,,,0,,,,
"LOFT will allow direct measurements of the black hole mass and spin through timing measurements, to compare with other estimates such as mass from optical studies or spin from the thermal X-ray continuum or the Fe K-line profile.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The spectral capabilities of LOFT will allow use of the energy dependence of amplitudes and phase delays in the QPOs together with the Fe-K line profiles to measure the compact object’s mass and spin, the disk inclination and to study massive black holes in the brightest active galactic nuclei (AGNs) by measuring with unprecedented accuracy the profiles and variability of their Fe K-lines.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Additionally, LOFT's good response to higher-energy X-rays is crucial for most of this work; the discoveries of the highest- frequency quasi-periodic oscillations from black holes – the ones which can be used to probe the mass and spins of the black holes – were made only above 13 keV, despite the much higher count rates at lower energies.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Similarly, reliable measurements of Fe lines can only be made when both the Fe spectral edges around 8-9 keV and the continuum at energies significantly higher than these edge energies can be well measured.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The conditions of strong-field gravity will be quantified by measuring the mass and spin of black holes (BH) and by verifying predictions of general relativity (GR), such as precession and epicyclic motion.",,,,,,0,,,,
"To these aims study of Quasi-Periodic-Oscillations (QPOs) in the time domain, Fe line reverberation and tomography in bright Active Galactic Nucleus (AGNs) and Galactic Black Hole Candidates (BHCs) will be exploited.",,,,,,1,,,,
"LOFT will additionally be a powerful observatory for studying the X-ray variability and spectra of a wide range of objects, from accreting pulsars and bursters, to magnetar candidates (Anomalous X-ray Pulsars and Soft Gamma Repeaters), cataclysmic variables, bright AGNs, X-ray transients and the early afterglows of Gamma Ray Bursts.",,,,,,0,,,,
Due to its high sensitivity it will also enable the study of disk- jet interaction.,,,,,,0,,,,
Through these studies it will be possible to address a variety of problems in the physics of these objects.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Coordinated optical/NIR and radio campaigns on specific themes, as well as spin measurements which can aid the Advanced Virgo/LIGO searches for gravitational wave signals from fast rotating neutron stars will add great value to the LOFT program.",,,,,,0,,,,
The minimum scientific success criteria for the mission are reached if the two core science objectives (TOP1 and TOP2) are achieved.,,,,,,1,,,,
It has been indicated in the description of these top level science objectives that supplementary observation strategies are followed to achieve this.,,,,,,0,,,,
The EoS and the QCD phase diagram is constrained by measuring neutron star masses with 4% accuracy and radii with an accuracy of 3% for 3 NSs.,,,,,,0,,,,
Strong-field general relativistic effects close to BHs and NSs are detected and BH masses and spins measured through time variability and spectroscopic measurements pf 3 BHs and 6 NSs.,,,,,,0,,,,
"For each of the level 0 objectives we have identified above a number of complementary methods to achieve these, these are specified quantitatively as our level 1 requirements.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Constrain the equation of state of supranuclear-density matter by the measurement, using three complementary types of pulsations, of mass and radius of at least 4 neutron stars with an instrumental accuracy of 4% in mass and 3% in radius1.",,,,,,0,,,,
Probe the interior structure of isolated neutron stars by observing seismic oscillations in Soft Gamma-ray Repeater intermediate flares when they occur with flux ~1000 Crab through high energy photons (> 20 keV).,,,,,,1,,,,
Detect strong-field GR effects by measuring epicyclic motions in high frequency QPOs from at least 3 black hole X-ray binaries and perform comparative studies in neutron stars.,,,,,,0,,,,
Detect disk precession due to relativistic frame dragging with the Fe line variations in low frequency QPOs for 10 neutron stars and 5 black holes.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Detect kHz QPOs at their coherence time, measure the waveforms and quantify the distortions due to strong-field GR for 10 neutron stars covering different inclinations and luminosities.",,,,,,0,,,,
The scientific objectives may be achieved through the measurement of the X-ray photometric light curves and spectra of a range of different astrophysical target classes.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The targets are all compact objects (neutron stars, stellar-mass as well as supermassive black holes) therefore the measurement requires no imaging capability.",,,,,,0,,,,
Targets will be selected by pointing a collimating structure that discriminates the required source from the diffuse background and nearby X-ray emitting sources.,,,,,,0,,,,
The photons from the selected target will be registered by an array of semiconductor detectors that will measure the X-ray photon energy and arrival time to high precision (~250eV FWHM and 10µs respectively).,,,,,,0,,,,
A large effective collecting area ensures that sufficient photons can be collected to accumulate spectra and precision photometry over the variability time scales of interest for the different target classes.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The energy resolution of the detector in combination with an energy range of 2 to 50 keV will enable the measurement of the Fe-line profile, needed for the Strong Field Gravity goals.",,,,,,0,,,,
The data will be transmitted to ground in the form of photon event lists (time and energy of each photon).,,,,,,0,,,,
To catch the relevant sources in outburst it is required to monitor a large fraction of the visible sky on a daily basis.,,,,,,0,,,,
"If a change in state of a source for the core program is observed, LOFT may be pointed to this source and repeated observations are feasible till the source state is no longer of interest.",,,,,,1,,,,
"This monitoring is enabled by a coded mask imaging technique, providing time- and energy sliced images of the available field of view, as well as spectra and light curves of bursts and transients.",,,,,,0,,,,
For the core science objectives processing of these data on the basis of a few days is sufficient to adjust the observation schedule if a source state changes.,,,,,,1,,,,
"As indicated in the section about science objectives, it is required that LOFT will allow ‘observatory type’ of science during the periods which are not required for the core science objectives.",,,,,,0,,,,
This will be a significant fraction of the observing time (>25%) and will be allocated on the basis of peer reviewed proposals.,,,,,,0,,,,
In this section we include a few of the most interesting topics.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The LOFT LAD and WFM will be very important for the study of thermo-nuclear explosions on the surface of neutron stars, so called Type I X-ray bursts.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Current instruments have revealed residuals in the spectra of a sub-set of these bursts (extreme radius-expansion bursts) suggesting the presence of absorption edges, perhaps arising from nuclear burning ashes mixed into the radiation-driven ejecta powered by the burst flux.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Such features have been predicted theoretically, and can provide information on the neutron star compactness.",,,,,,0,,,,
"However, as the occurrence of such extreme Type I bursts is unpredictable and as they occur infrequently, high-quality spectra have proved difficult to obtain.",,,,,,0,,,,
The LOFT WFM should allow for the detection of these bursts with sufficient spectral resolution to investigate if the neutron star compactness can be constrained.,,,,,,1,,,,
The LOFT mission will be capable to advance the field of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) significantly.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The LOFT WFM energy band, sensitivity, field of view, source location accuracy and energy resolution are well suited for the investigation of some of the open issues in the study of GRBs.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Some of the issues include: the models for the physics of prompt emission, the existence and properties of spectral absorption features by circum-burst material (and hence the nature of the progenitors), the detection and rate of high-z GRBs (which is important for the investigation of the early universe).",,,,,,0,,,,
Another area where in particular the WFM will contribute is that of X-ray flashes.,,,,,,0,,,,
WFM studies of the population and properties of X-ray flashes found to accompany supernova shock break-out and the disruption of stars and planetary objects by supermassive black holes should provide important results.,,,,,,0,,,,
"A last example in this (incomplete) report on the LOFT Observatory Science involves the study of the magnetic accretion in, for instance, high-mass X-ray binaries.",,,,,,0,,,,
The LOFT/LAD is ideally suited to study the X-ray time variability on timescales of a fraction of the neutron star spin period.,,,,,,0,,,,
The variability is also reflected in the observed spectral properties such as the centroid energy of the cyclotron lines.,,,,,,0,,,,
The prime instrument of the mission is the large Area Detector (LAD).,,,,,,0,,,,
This is a non-focusing but collimated X-ray detector with a very large collecting area.,,,,,,0,,,,
"This allows for very-high count rates and combined with its spectral resolution, allows researchers also to carry out spectral analysis of bright objects.",,,,,,0,,,,
A large area detector with a collimated field of view (~1 degree).,,,,,,0,,,,
Good spectral resolution using Silicon Drift Detectors (~ 240eV).,,,,,,0,,,,
"It should be d that not all events can be reconstructed with the same resolution, depending on the number of anodes to reconstruct the energy.",,,,,,1,,,,
A high level of modularity (the different detector segments operate independently) increasing the level of redundancy.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The loss of a whole panel and subsequent reduction in effective area may compromise some capability (e.g. EOS2), however many science goals could be completed albeit with longer observation times.",,,,,,1,,,,
The instrument requirements are summarized in Table 5-1 and more details are given for each requirement later.,,,,,,0,,,,
Part of the justification of the requirements is given in the subsequent paragraphs but especially the flow down is discussed in Appendix A where also the relations between the different requirements are explained.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The effective area requirement is given at 4 energies (maximum of the distribution, a high energy cut-off and at two lower energies).",,,,,,0,,,,
The effective area is directly related to the stopping power in the detector and the transmission of the thermal blanket and any inactive layer on top of the detector.,,,,,,0,,,,
Especially at the low cut-off the effective area is a steep function of energy and the given energy should be interpreted as energy ± 0.5 keV.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The projected collecting area for photons (a function of photon energy) determined as the product of geometric area and detectors’ quantum efficiency, transmission factors of collimators, and associated thermal/optical shields.",,,,,,0,,,,
Justification Effective area provides the translation from a source flux to detected count rate.,,,,,,0,,,,
"This requirement is the minimum detector effective area, near the peak of source photon and variability distribution in energy, that is required to ensure the most driving science case can be fulfilled (determine masses and radii of neutron stars , investigate gravity in the strong field regime).",,,,,,0,,,,
This area is required to reduce the statistical errors on the mass and radius to < 4% and < 3% respectively.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The soft part of the spectrum is important for strong red wings in very broad Fe lines, see also SCI-LAD-R-03 [GOALS SFG2, SFG4, SFG5].",,,,,,0,,,,
A factor ~40% of the peak area is necessary to guarantee adequate modelling of the source spectral shape Justification See requirement but the goal is 10% more ambitious.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Justification: To ensure that the LAD effective area does not change by more than ~20% over the energy interval (5-8 keV) in which the broad Fe-K lines are detected and studied.GOALS: SFG2, SFG4 and SFG5.",,,,,,0,,,,
Justification See requirement but the goal is 10% more ambitious.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification To detect QPOs during intermediate flares of SGR/AXP, to detect the continuum emission of bright AGN (>1 mCrab) with a S/N of 200 to measure the Compton Justification See requirement but the goal is 10% more ambitious.,,,,,,0,,,
To allow for unambiguous interpretation the lowest number (9.5m2) in this range has been specified as requirement.,,,,,,0,,,,
"However, this requirement is inter-related to several other requirements including the spectral resolution, the field of regard and the redundancy requirement.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Deviations in the effective area can, for a significant part of the science, be compensated by a suitable combination of sky visibility and longer mission duration (see also appendix A).",,,,,,0,,,,
With the tuning of these other requirements the impact of the reduced area on the science can be made small.,,,,,,0,,,,
In addition the 25% redundancy requirement may need to be adjusted in order to maintain a 7.5 m2 effective area in case of a single point failure.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Justification to limit the impact of systematics in studies that require knowledge of absolute flux, e.g. accurate measurements of the Eddington luminosity during Type I bursts, translating into a (minimum) uncertainty of 7-8% in the determination of the radius of neutron stars through this technique.",,,,,,0,,,,
Justification see requirement but uncertainties will be further reduced.,,,,,,0,,,,
The lower and upper energies measured for detected photons after reconstruction.,,,,,,0,,,,
For primary range the nominal binning appropriate to detector energy resolution shall apply.,,,,,,0,,,,
For extended range a binning factor in energy may be applied.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: 2 keV: to be able to study photoelectric absorption and soft components of a variety of sources, 30 keV: to determine the AGN and X-ray binary continuum spectra in order to study the reflection/absorption effects and allow for an accurate determination of the Fe-K line profile.,,,,,,1,,,
"After applying all known calibration factors, the linearity and offset of the energy scale applying to a measured spectrum shall allow a photon energy to be determined to within a small fraction.",,,,,,1,,,,
Justification: to combine data from different epochs the energy scale should be known with a fraction (1/4) of the energy resolution (reference point is 6 keV).,,,,,,0,,,,
"Justification: End-of-mission spectral resolution integrated over the full detector but after channel to channel corrections (e.g. gain); Using both single and double anode events this resolution allows for gravitationally broadened Fe Kα line-width studies, removal of narrow lines and edges, line/edge studies in PRE type I X-ray bursts.",,,,,,0,,,,
This number includes all not-correctable contributions to the spectral resolution.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The available margin on top of the Fano limit of Si will be distributed over different components (calibration, sensor uniformity, gain knowledge etc).",,,,,,0,,,,
See also appendix D and Tech on defined contributions to energy resolution.,,,,,,0,,,,
Selected events are only those that correspond to the read-out of a single anode (explaining the 40% of the selected events).,,,,,,1,,,,
The requirements are split between all events and the events that will be collected on a single anode of the detector (40% of the events).,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: Not all science goals require optimal energy resolution.,,,,,,0,,,,
See section 7 (observation plan) and appendix A for more Justification: a degraded energy resolution similar to the requirement “standard” energy resolution effectively means a larger FoR.,,,,,,0,,,,
The FWHM of distribution in transparency of the instrument (i.e. collimator) at the peak energy for the effective area.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: Limiting confusion in crowded fields.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Thist source confusion can be mitigated using offset-pointings Justification: improved background, affecting fewer sources and reducing the need for offset pointings.",,,,,,0,,,,
"However this is related to the response stability, it can only be considered if the response stability goals are within reach.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The fraction of photons, at specified energy, that reach the detector plane following transmission through the collimator from a large off-axis angle (for reference purposes 45°).",,,,,,0,,,,
"Justification: some response is required at off-axis angles to be able to observe seismic oscillations in SGR (EOS3), the value is not critical as long as it is in this range (0.02 – 0.2 %).",,,,,,0,,,,
This can be achieved by either a transparent collimator at higher energies or by a fraction of the LAD area which has no collimator at all.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The key science requirement is to avoid any spurious (e.g., induced by a variable instrument response) modulation in the measured source count rate, down to a level of the astrophysical signal of interest.",,,,,,0,,,,
"As the latter highly depends on the type of source/signal and its characteristic frequencies, it is hard to specify the requirement with a single number.",,,,,,1,,,,
The derivation of these requirements is explained in [RD 3].,,,,,,0,,,,
Response stability is the broad-band (e.g. 2-30keV) effective area as a function of frequency.,,,,,,0,,,,
In practice this is derived from a Fourier transform of the effective area as a function of time.,,,,,,0,,,,
On timescales of light crossing time of a few gravitational radii (10’s seconds) the signature of reflection lags must robustly be determined.,,,,,,0,,,,
Low frequency QPOs seem correlated with broad band noise phenomena.,,,,,,0,,,,
Unstable response leads to apparent noise in constant flux sources and also to QPO broadening or sidebands.,,,,,,1,,,,
Intrinsic to the detector is that the arrival time of an event is not known much better than 10(7) µsec as the drift time through the detector depends on the position of the event with respect to the anode.,,,,,,1,,,,
"However, as this distribution is stable and uniform, the absolute time knowledge should be better (2 µsec).",,,,,,0,,,,
"The 3σ uncertainty in assigning the time datum of an event to its actual arrival time on the LAD Justification: Behaviour of matter under extreme conditions and ultra-dense matter – modelling waveforms of periodic signals, X-ray burst oscillations and QPOs.",,,,,,0,,,,
Moreover searches for very short impulsive phenomena.,,,,,,0,,,,
The absolute time accuracy requirement is higher than the detector time resolution.,,,,,,0,,,,
"For pulsars, knowing the detection time with an accuracy of 2 microsecond allows comparison with other wavebands (e.g. radio).",,,,,,1,,,,
"Justification: Giant pulses from Crab and msec radio pulsars are very brief (some as short as 0.5 us, observed in radio at 0.125 us resolution and rising within that time (Knight et al.",,,,,,0,,,,
The critical parameter is the dead time knowledge but with a too large dead time it will be hard to reduce the error.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Justification: Dead time is relevant to all sources where we want to do accurate characterization of aperiodic phenomena, particularly at high frequency (1/t_dead).",,,,,,0,,,,
We need to be able to calibrate the dead-time process to an accuracy better than the precision afforded by the count rates.,,,,,,0,,,,
"That is, if you can measure the Fourier transform to a certain precision given the count rate, then the uncertainty in the distortions induced by dead time to the Fourier transform should be less than that precision.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Equivalent flux of all cosmic diffuse, external particle and internally generated events that cannot be distinguished from true X-ray events from the target in the LAD field of view Justification: Some of the science goals are related to low flux sources (1-10 mCrab) such as AGNs and some accretion powered X-ray pulsar and black hole transients.",,,,,,0,,,,
The lower goal increases the number of (AGNs) sources accessible to the LAD.,,,,,,0,,,,
The accuracy with which the equivalent background flux is known after ground based application Justification: Some of the science goals are related to low flux sources (1-10 mCrab) such as AGNs and some accretion powered X-ray pulsars.,,,,,,0,,,,
The spectral analysis of these sources is sensitive to residual systematics after background subtraction.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: only sources brighter than 0.5 Crab require temporal re-binning.,,,,,,0,,,,
Bright transient sources can be stored on-board and the full information can be transferred during subsequent ground contacts.,,,,,,1,,,,
Around 30 sources in the observation plan have intensities > 250 mCrab and around 20 sources > 500 mCrab.,,,,,,0,,,,
These sources will in general be observed during their bright state and require then the sustained data rate.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Justification: improved performance, typical 10 sources will be above this level.",,,,,,0,,,,
This does not drive the design in view of the spectral slope and the stopping power of the collimator for photons < 20 keV where the bulk of the photons are for these 1000 Crab sources.,,,,,,1,,,,
Justification: Behaviour of matter under extreme conditions – modelling lines and waveforms of X-ray burst oscillations for instance during type I X-ray bursts.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: Behaviour of matter under extreme conditions.,,,,,,0,,,,
Brightest state of Sco-X-1 and very bright transients.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The amount of data storage to be provided in the LAD sub-system for extended downlink, commensurate with the data generated by a bright target for specified duration Justification: Being able to retrieve all data over a number of ground contacts for bright and unexpected transients, taking advantage from long observation of weak sources (e.g., AGNs).",,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: In case of a major failure 75% of the area will still allow to achieve the minimum success criteria.,,,,,,0,,,,
The main goal of the WFM is to provide good triggers of active sources for the LAD.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Desirable trigger levels for bright transients is 100 mCrab for part of the sky accessible to LAD as 90% of these transients in this part of the sky should be identified, weaker transients (about achieved by a FoV that is a compromise between the accessible sky and the dimensions of the Galactic Centre region (~60 degree).",,,,,,0,,,,
A detailed trade-off has been determined (see RD 12).,,,,,,0,,,,
Sensitivity (5 σ detection) over 50 ks must be < 5 mCrab over energy range of 2 - 50 keV for a field where there is no source confusion (outside the Galactic Centre).,,,,,,1,,,,
The total allocation for the WFM data (in normal operations) is 10% of the total telemetry band width with a maximum of 100 kbits/s.,,,,,,0,,,,
"If the LAD data rate is <80%, the WFM should be able to use up the available bandwidth.",,,,,,1,,,,
Energy range and telemetry bandwidth should allow at least 8 spectral bands for the detection of spectral state changes in transient sources and be sensitive to thermal (e.g. disk) spectral components.,,,,,,1,,,,
The angular resolution and source localization accuracy are related and the source localization depends also in the signal to noise ratio.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Justification: Reduce crowding effects, and allow for better multi-wavelength follow-up.",,,,,,0,,,,
"For each WFM camera, the FWHM angular distribution for a point source.",,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: For sources of the specified brightness the driving requirement is the localization accuracy.,,,,,,0,,,,
The localization depends on the angular resolution and the signal to noise ratio.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The equivalent flux that can be detected in the centre of the WFM field, for a point source and for a given observation time.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Justification: 1s: Fast events of all kinds: SGRs, AXPs bursts/flares, X-ray flashes and bursts.",,,,,,0,,,,
Source detection sensitivity scales with the signal to noise ratio.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Justification: Improved performance, especially opening up new parameter space (e.g. very fast transient events).",,,,,,0,,,,
"Following the application of calibration data, the accuracy with which the equivalent flux of a high S:N detected source can be specified.",,,,,,0,,,,
The reference shall be targets recommended by International Astronomical Consortium for High Energy Calibration.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: Cross calibrations with observations performed with other X-ray instruments.,,,,,,0,,,,
"After applying all calibration knowledge, the relative change in flux sensitivity with off-axis angle must be known to a small fraction and within radii corresponding with an area at least 20% of peak on-axis area.",,,,,,1,,,,
Justification Relative calibration of the flux determination precision of the WFM at varying off- axis angles down to 20% of the peak effective area.,,,,,,0,,,,
This provides an upper limit on the systematic errors in source light curves as they are derived from different pointings placing the sources in different cameras and at different off-axis angles.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification further lowering the systematics in source light curves.,,,,,,0,,,,
"After applying all ground based calibration knowledge, the accuracy of determining the flux of any given target, and the also minimum flux sensitivity, from one pointing period to another.",,,,,,1,,,,
Justification Relative knowledge of variations in the sensitivity of the WFM over the mission duration.,,,,,,0,,,,
Needed to cross check with other observations made of similar sky locations at different observing times and to maintain absolute flux calibration.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Compared with R-18, this prioritises the relative change in sensitivity with time.",,,,,,0,,,,
Justification Further reducing the systematic errors in long term variations of sources.,,,,,,0,,,,
A selectable duration over which counts are integrated to detect a count rate increase for triggering burst mode.,,,,,,0,,,,
The time scales are typical for the transient events to be studied in detail with the full resolution data to rise significantly above the background level.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Full resolution data for validated triggers will be stored for nominally 300 s around the burst trigger time, including a pre-burst interval.",,,,,,0,,,,
Transients with longer time scales can be studied with the normal image data with 300 s integration time.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Justification: Triggering sensitivity to very short events (e.g., TGFs: Terrestrial Gamma- ray Flashes).",,,,,,0,,,,
The coverage of the celestial sphere provided by the ensemble of WFM units.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Justification: Need to match as closely as possible the sky that is accessible to the LAD at any one time, but limited to 180 degrees centred around the LAD pointing.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Allow study of the long term variability of AGNs, type I X-ray burst history, provide triggers for e.g. state changes and the occurrence of super-bursts.",,,,,,0,,,,
"For a typical pointing, 50% of the accessible part of the sky of the LAD should match with 20% of the WFM peak effective area.",,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: Part of the LAD accessible sky would otherwise not be monitored.,,,,,,0,,,,
The lower and upper energies measured for detected photons in spectral accumulation mode.,,,,,,0,,,,
For primary range the nominal binning of 100eV shall apply.,,,,,,0,,,,
For extended range a further binning factor in energy may be applied.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Justification: Soft response, below 5 keV important for high redshift GRBs, study of type I X- ray bursts, supernova-shock break out: Science products in the primary energy range: Extended dynamic range up to 80 keV intended for monitoring of very bright sources (>1 Crab) as part of LAD background monitoring strategy.",,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: Allows better signal to noise ratio for the same geometrical detector area.,,,,,,0,,,,
FWHM of a Gaussian distribution response to a monoenergetic stimulus of the detector Justification: Allows scientific products from WFM such as spectra for bight sources but it is not driving the design as the number of sources with sufficient countrates and spectral features is Justification: Improved energy resolution could eventually help.,,,,,,0,,,,
The energy resolution (and hence the scale) is not a main driver for the WFM.,,,,,,0,,,,
This allows scientific products from WFM such as edges from type I bursts.,,,,,,1,,,,
Justification: Even though not a main driver several Observatory Science cases would benefit.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: Allows the downlink of limited data in a number of energy bands that match interesting regions in the energy spectrum.,,,,,,1,,,,
Justification: Typical integration time for images is 300 s (yet programmable).,,,,,,0,,,,
The time scale corresponds to the resolution needed to monitor the intensity of non-bursting sources.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The time resolution of triggered data will, however, be more accurate (10 µs) in the event by event mode.",,,,,,0,,,,
This number matches the time information of the LAD.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: Higher performance for brighter sources.,,,,,,0,,,,
The accuracy with which the WFM time datum can be assiged to UTC after ground calibration.,,,,,,0,,,,
The cadence of total count rate data per camera in 8 TBD energy bands.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: Provide the ability to study time coherent or non-coherent time variability on shorter time scales than the normal 300 s integration for imaging data and in cases where imaging is not required to identify the source.,,,,,,0,,,,
The primary use will be the monitoring of X- ray pulsars (coherent sources) over longer time scales.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: WFM will be used to identify transient events and state changes in X-ray sources.,,,,,,0,,,,
The presence of transients or state changes could result in follow up (ToO) with the LAD (prime mission science) or with measurements by other (ground based/space based) instruments.,,,,,,0,,,,
The transients may be detected both in triggered data and in normal data if the transient rise time is >100s or a spectral state change has occurred.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Justification: Factor 2 faster, it is not expected that this will drive the design and is acceptable if this is not reached for 100% of the cases.",,,,,,1,,,,
Justification Onboard memory will store up to 3 hours of data (although depending on the event rate some binning is foreseen for bright events/episodes/areas).,,,,,,1,,,,
"After a trigger into burst mode, the WFM will attempt to localise the source on the sky and determine the time of trigger.",,,,,,1,,,,
These data will be broadcast in a Burst Alert message.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Justification: If broadcasted, a set of ground receivers can see the trigger times and positions for follow up measurements.",,,,,,1,,,,
A 30 sec latency is a reasonable number based on the chain of data transmission to the end-user.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: Enhanced performance of the full system handling burst alerts.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Justification Estimates suggest there should be at least 150 GRB per year detected by WFM, therefore statistically several per day should be accommodated.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Justification: Other triggers such as Type 1 X-ray bursts, as well as potential false triggers imply the need for relatively frequent downloading of burst triggers.",,,,,,1,,,,
The design and geometric arrangement of the WFM shall be such that in the case of a single point failure still the full FoV should be covered although it is accepted that the effective area as well as the angular resolution for a certain part of the sky is reduced.,,,,,,1,,,,
Justification: storage of all event data for very bright transients in a continuous fashion without gaps (or less bright transients over longer periods).,,,,,,0,,,,
This allows for transmission of these data to the ground after the transient event happened without loss of information.,,,,,,1,,,,
Justification: the same but with increased capability.,,,,,,0,,,,
In this section science requirements for the system are given.,,,,,,0,,,,
This is clearly related to the instrument requirements but also to the strawman observing plan (see section 7).,,,,,,0,,,,
The WFM is less than 10% of the total bandwidth unless a Guest Observer requests this to be higher.,,,,,,1,,,,
The amount of observing time required to execute the nominal core science topics.,,,,,,0,,,,
The goal is to have the mission extended by one year 50% of that time is reserved for core-science and 50% for observatory science.,,,,,,0,,,,
The core science time is related to the top-level goals (see section 4.1) and the observatory science is related to the third top level goal.,,,,,,0,,,,
Amount of observing time that can be devoted to non-core science topics Justification: In addition to the core science about 50% of the net observing time is proposed for observatory science.,,,,,,0,,,,
All time will be allocated through a peer review process Justification: In case of an extended mission life time (to 5 year) it is expected to increase the guest observing time as well.,,,,,,0,,,,
The calibration time is specified as a fraction of the total net observing time.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Sufficient time should be allocated for periodic calibrations, both internal (electrical) and external (astrophysics sources).",,,,,,0,,,,
This number is based on past experience and not on a detailed calibration plan.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: Maintain the same quality but over the mission lifetime its performance can be predicted and less calibration time is required.,,,,,,0,,,,
"There is no theoretical limit on the shortest observation time and hence, during night time there will be additional observing time if the satellite slews to a given position.",,,,,,1,,,,
Considering the slew rate we do not expect this will be very efficient.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Nevertheless, from a science perspective some sources only accessible from the night side will be very interesting and this is estimated to be one strong source (1 Crab) and 10 weak sources (150 mCrab) per year.",,,,,,0,,,,
Considering typical decay times it would be required to observe these sources over as many orbit that the source is visible (up to two weeks).,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: Increases observing efficiency for sources outside FoR.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The energy resolution should be < 260 eV for SFG2, SFG4 and SFG5.",,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: Combined with the mission duration (4 years) this gives a 98% probability to detect two BHCT and 98% to detect two AMXPs.,,,,,,0,,,,
For various science goals (see section 7) the energy resolution is not critical.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: This increases the probability to detect 2 BHCT and AMXPs to 99% for a 4 year mission and would still be 98% for a 3 year mission.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Furthermore, it allows Observatory science to be done in the Galactic Centre area on the sky.",,,,,,0,,,,
Otherwise (50% sky visibility) the observation time when the bulge is visible to LOFT is used for a significant fraction by observing the core-science targets.,,,,,,1,,,,
The fraction of yearly coverage of the Galactic Centre location that is within the LAD Extended Field of Regard.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: 35% corresponds to the Extended Field of Regard requirement of 50% of the sky [SCI-SYS-R-05] and allows for sufficiently long net observing time of the Galactic Centre to meet the top level goals.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: This number corresponds to the Extended Field of Regard goal of 75% of the sky [SCI-SYS-G-05] and will optimize the science return as it enables longer viewing of the Galactic Centre which is important for the observatory science.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Justification: With a 4 year mission all requirements in terms of observing time, probability to catch rare events and energy resolution are achieved with margin.",,,,,,0,,,,
Details are given in appendix A. Justification: A longer mission duration allows for a larger science return.,,,,,,0,,,,
The accuracy of pointing the LAD boresight towards a catalogued target.,0,,,,,,,,,
"This shall be a 3σ radius value, and applies once the LAD boresight to star tracker offset is calibrated in orbit.",1,,,,,,,,,
Justification: This is well within the field of view of the LAD.,1,,,,,,,,,
It also corresponds to the accuracy with which the WFM can determine a source position.,0,,,,,,,,,
This requirement is coupled to the stability requirement of the LAD pointing.,0,,,,,,,,,
However this is TBD and not driving Justification: Reduces gradient of response vs. pointing in LAD to provide more margin in response stability.,0,,,,,,,,,
The instantaneous reported star tracker reference axis location .,0,,,,,,,,,
Justification: Any pointing jitter can be corrected on the ground if we have good knowledge about the pointing.,1,,,,,,,,,
"This provides additional margin, especially in the case of finite frequencies that exceed the SCI-LAD-G-26 specification.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The AMA should be small compared to the FoV, but the actual number (20 arcsec) is an engineering estimate and not strictly deduced from the science requirements.",0,,,,,,,,,
Any distortions in the relative alignment in the LAD is included in the pointing error and not in this AMA.,0,,,,,,,,,
Justification: As many star trackers provide few arcseconds pointing knowledge it would be nice to have this but it is not really required.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Requirements on orbit are derived from a requirement on instrument background rates, stability and radiation damage due to charged particles.",0,,,,,,,,,
At this level we only give a top level requirement and more details are given in the MRD.,0,,,,,,,,,
Justification: Only a LEO orbit provides a low enough background.,1,,,,,,,,,
In combination with a low inclination the radiation damage to the detectors will be low enough to have them passively cooled and still reach the end-of-life temperature requirements.,1,,,,,,,,,
Justification: A lower inclination will reduce the effects of the SAA.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Justification: This allows for slewing of the satellite during monitoring campaigns and is directly related to SCI-SYS-R-04, this is NOT equal to the average number of slews per orbit which depend on the observation plan (see RD4).",1,,,,,,,,,
Justification: This increases the number of potential observations of otherwise inaccessible targets (at a given time) by a factor 2.,1,,,,,,,,,
Although not the prime science it is clear that fast response times will enable additional science.,1,,,,,,,,,
The provided requirements are supposed not to drive the design but are nevertheless ambitious in the sense that the ToO response time should be optimized within the planned ground system.,0,,,,,,,,,
Justification: LOFT is not a mission dedicated to fast transients (like SWIFT).,1,,,,,,,,,
"However, it is important to be able to respond to state changes in sources at a reasonable rate (called ToOs).",0,,,,,,,,,
Therefore the ToO response time should not drive the design of the ground system.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Clearly, this requirement should not inhibit faster response times in case a ToO is identified at the beginning of a working day.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Although many targets will be triggered by a change in state, the number of ToOs is limited as subsequent observations of a target which changed state, will be pre-planned at the time of the first observation and do not need re-planning of the observation schedule.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Following the change of a source state, the relevant sources will be on between something like a week to very long periods (campaigns up to one year after the transient trigger may be expected).",1,,,,,,,,,
This makes a response of < 12 hours for the core science not mandatory.,1,,,,,,,,,
Clearly a faster response will improve the science in general (see the goal).,1,,,,,,,,,
"A Quick Look data analysis subsystem should be provided at SOC (and SDC) in order to determine the properties of triggering sources and LAD target object in order to provide an alert for observation plan changes, and verify LOFT Burst Alert messages.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The analysis using a QLA system should be powerful enough to be able to identify source spectral and brightness changes that allow an alert for new ToOs to be generated, or identify failure to meet observing proposal criteria.",1,,,,,,,,,
The planning cycle to update the observing plan shall be <7days and therefore QLA should be able to generate the required data for Duty Scientist decision on a much shorter timescale.,1,,,,,,,,,
The re-planning timescales should be faster to avoid loss of useful observing time.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The science data rate generated by the instruments, after nominal binning and lossless compression ratios, when observing a source at the typical LAD brightness for event mode data.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Justification: For a 150 mCrab source, observed with an efficiency of 60% the data rates must support the full LAD event mode data.",1,,,,,,,,,
Simultaneously data for nominal event modes for the WFM should be transmitted (100 kbps).,0,,,,,,,,,
Justification: Increase in the data rate for the WFM to exploit fully the available transmission rate.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The science data rate generated by the instruments, after nominal binning and lossless compression ratios, when observing a source at the maximum LAD brightness for event mode data.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Justification: For a 500 mCrab source, observed with an efficiency of 60% the data rates must support all LAD event mode data.",1,,,,,,,,,
Simultaneously all data for nominal event modes for the WFM plus the transmission of data stored on board for previous measurements.,0,,,,,,,,,
Justification: Increase of the LAD source to >1 Crab without loss of information.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Justification: This is linked to the previous science requirement SCI-SYS-R16 (500 mCrab) , and SCI-LAD-R19 and the minimal telemetry of the WFM, under the assumption of no loss of LAD information within the above limits.",1,,,,,,,,,
Justification: Enables the higher sustained rate required by the goal SCI-SYS-R-16 in the previous requirement.,1,,,,,,,,,
In Table 7-1 the total observing time per core science requirement is given split over the different source categories.,0,,,,,,,,,
Also the number of required sources per category is given as well as the number of observed sources.,0,,,,,,,,,
"This number of observed sources is larger than the number of required sources as it is not always known a priori if a source is in a given state, We also specify whether the spectral resolution is important for the science goal (Fe-line characterization).",1,,,,,,,,,
"For the Neutron Stars, both transient outburst NS and the transient weak NS will be observed.",1,,,,,,,,,
From these we expect that 3 will have the properties of an AMXP which are then observed for a longer period.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Most classes of sources serve to address >1 science goal as is already indicated in Table produced based on this table, and for the purposes of deriving the impact of the observing plan on the system, has been made applicable to the mission in the MRD.",1,,,,,,,,,
It should be recognized that a ToO for LOFT is of a different nature than ‘usual’ observatory ToOs.,0,,,,,,,,,
"When the source state changes, a change in the observing program can be triggered but then, for this source, a campaign of weeks to longer periods is started.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Only when, during this campaign, the source fades away, the campaign can be stopped to save observing time.",1,,,,,,,,,
"So, effectively we expect about 60 ToOs over the mission life time.",1,,,,,,,,,
Despite this difference with the more usual use of ToOs (changes in the observation plan by external triggers) we have kept the name as it would result in a re-planning of the observation schedule.,0,,,,,,,,,
Note that observation of the same source can be used for different science goals.,0,,,,,,,,,
The NS transient outburst NS and the transient weak NS will be observed.,0,,,,,,,,,
Average time per pointing is total time/total pointings.,0,,,,,,,,,
"If the total number of pointings is a concern, pointings of less than 10 ks can be added up to make pointings of at least 10 ksec in length.",1,,,,,,,,,
For some ~10 of AGN2 sources additional offset background fields are needed (~700ks total).,1,,,,,,,,,
There should be several “standard” background fields that must be quasi-periodically revisited to monitor the evolution of background.,1,,,,,,,,,
Observing times and schedules in the overwhelming majority of cases are set by intrinsic source state variations rather than by S/N considerations.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Sources have different spectral/timing states, and we need to sample each state over a range of luminosities in order to understand the processes we are detecting with LOFT, or in order to catch a source in the right state to see the process in the first place.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Transients are named that will likely not be on, these serve as placeholders for similar transients that will be discovered by LOFT WFM and perhaps other means.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The total observing time required for the top level science requirement is 24.7 Ms, which corresponds with a realistic but conservative observing efficiency of 50% to 1.6 years elapsed time of which ToO targets are to cover several flux levels in each source).",1,,,,,,,,,
"However, it should be recognized that we need a longer mission duration to ensure a good probability to observe the rare transient events needed for some of the science goals.",1,,,,,,,,,
"There are no SGRs in the table as we only have the serendipitous offset observations as a top level goal – we DO plan to have TOO triggers in place for when an SGR becomes active, to point at them to see if intermediate flares happen – this is not guaranteed to succeed, hence not a top level goal.",1,,,,,,,,,
A preliminary breakdown (based on reasonable assumptions on the targets for Observatory science) of observing time spent at different viewing directions is given in [RD 4].,0,,,,,,,,,
"A final consideration for the observation plan is the mission life time to have a good probability to catch rare events: BHCT in the intermediate state with HF QPOs, and AMXPs.",0,,,,,,,,,
We have selected realistic assumptions in the sense that we do not take into account that the number can be larger due to the huge improvement in the sensitivity of LOFT compared to RXTE.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Still we assume that some of the known, persistent, sources will be active in the LOFT era.",0,,,,,,,,,
This includes GRS1915+105 (BH transient outburst) and NGC 6440X-2 (AMXP).,0,,,,,,,,,
This probability has to be folded with the field of regard of the mission (as it is of no use if LOFT cannot observe the source when it becomes active due to viewing constraints.,1,,,,,,,,,
Based on these expectations it is concluded that the minimum life time of the mission should be 4 years for a sky visibility of +30/-50 degree and 3 years for +30/-70 degree.,1,,,,,,,,,
Under these conditions the expectation for 3 BH transient outbursts and AMXPs is around 95% and the probability of detecting two in each group is larger than 99%.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Also, with a conservative estimate of 50% observing efficiency the full program can be performed.",1,,,,,,,,,
There is only a limited effect on attaining the core objectives.,0,,,,,,,,,
"It will, of course, affect the overall science return of the mission as it reduces the discovery space.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Hence the nominal Field of Regard with nominal spectral resolution is driven by those core science objectives which need good spectral resolution (SFG2, SFG4, SFG5) and for the other science goals the extended field of regard can be used.",1,,,,,,,,,
"If good spectral resolution is available also for the observations aimed at the other core science objectives, it will enable a desirable a larger field of regard or extended field of regard allow for a shorter mission duration provided we can execute the observations for the core science (e.g. sky visibility of the Galactic Centre is sufficient).",1,,,,,,,,,
"Although the number of combinations is large, two issues are driving part of the instrument and mission design: the effective area and the sky visibility with good or degraded energy resolution.",0,,,,,,,,,
We can demonstrate that the current instrument and mission requirements have a safe margin for these parameters.,0,,,,,,,,,
In Table A-1 we provide an overview of the science impact of a reduced effective area.,0,,,,,,,,,
"For this we provide first the basic effects of a reduced area, followed by the potential mitigation.",0,,,,,,,,,
"As is indicated some of the L1 core requirements can be fully compensated but in other cases some loss of science (less sensitivity, fewer sources) can also be the consequence.",1,,,,,,,,,
"In the last columns of this table we quantify the effect of a reduction to 70%, sources.",0,,,,,,,,,
In summary this analysis shows that the core science goals are not at stake if the effective area reduces by the order of 10%.,1,,,,,,,,,
"However, some of the science goals will be less ambitious (e.g. a slight reduction in the number of AGNs on which LOFT can perform highly significant Fe line tomography) whereas others can be still achieved but require (significantly) longer observation times (and hence mission duration).",0,,,,,,,,,
When larger reductions in the effective area are needed it is strongly recommended to optimize some of these other design parameters.,1,,,,,,,,,
The Nominal Field of Regard is the part of the sky which can be observed with the nominal energy resolution and the extended field of regard has been introduced to allow for observations of sources where the energy resolution is not required.,1,,,,,,,,,
The required field of regard is 35% of the sky (corresponding to the FoV in the M3 proposal) and the extended field of regard is 50%.,0,,,,,,,,,
In practice this implies that for the extended field of regard the thermal requirements on the LAD instrument will be less stringent.,0,,,,,,,,,
"A second factor which needs to be folded in is that a fraction of the relevant sources for LOFT is in the Galactic Centre, which implies that we need to consider the fraction of observing time for the Galactic Centre separately from the total observing time.",0,,,,,,,,,
In Table A-2 we summarize the required observing times for the core program (top half) and the available observing time on the Galactic Centre for different assumptions.,0,,,,,,,,,
"As can be seen there is a considerable margin between the needed observing time with good spectral resolution and the available observing time (needed 8.1, available 17.8 for a 4 year mission).",1,,,,,,,,,
Also with a shorter mission the margin is significant.,1,,,,,,,,,
The last factor to be considered is the observing time available for the BHCT and AMXPs.,0,,,,,,,,,
In total we require for these very bright sources 3.4 Ms which is not predictable in time (and may happen at a part of the year when the Galactic Centre is poorly visible).,0,,,,,,,,,
Of these sources the BHCT require a campaign length of 100 – AMXPs require observing campaigns of typical 20 days (total required time is 300 ks per AMXP).,0,,,,,,,,,
This potential risk is mitigated by the allowance of regular out of field of regard observations (due to the few hour thermal intertia of the system).,1,,,,,,,,,
"As can be seen from Table A-2 the visibility with a very small solar constraint (± 10o) gives still a total of 8.7 Ms for a 4 year mission, well in excess over the needed observing time.",1,,,,,,,,,
"LOFT will provide a unique combination of effective area, energy bandwidth and spectral resolution.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The area, also in connection with the field of regard, has been discussed above and here we will discuss the justification and trade-offs for the energy resolution and bandwidth.",0,,,,,,,,,
The energy resolution and bandwidth are driven primarily by the Strong Field Gravity science goals.,0,,,,,,,,,
It is very important to have the broadband energy coverage to model the reflection properties measuring both Fe line profile and Compton reflection continuum above 10 keV.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The good leverage on the continuum in a broad energy band will allow us to disentangle all spectral components and, in turn, to correctly model the residuals of the Fe line.",1,,,,,,,,,
The power of the broad energy range in determining model parameters has been recently demonstrated by XMM and NuStar analysis of NGC1365 (Risaliti et al.,0,,,,,,,,,
"In this respect the high energy response of LOFT is unique, covering simultaneously the 2-30 keV band with a great improvement in effective area in both low and high energy ranges, a factor >60 higher with respect to XMM in the Fe K domain and a factor of ~30 with respect to NuStar or Astro-H at 30 keV.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The 2 keV low end of the bandwidth has been set to enable the study of photo electric absorption and soft components, the 30 keV allows one to determine the AGN and X-ray binary continuum spectra in order to study reflection or absorption effects and allow for the accurate determination of the continuum underneath the Fe-K line profile.",1,,,,,,,,,
With an upper range of 80 keV (no specific resolution is required) fast high-energy phenomena such as SGR/AXP flares can be studied.,1,,,,,,,,,
In practice these bandwidth limits are not absolute limits but the science will degrade gradually (an effect of about 10% in the energy thresholds has a small effect on the science but it depends somewhat on details of the science case).,1,,,,,,,,,
"It should be d that the energy range is unique for the WFM and will, for the first time enable the monitoring of the sky below 5 keV with CCD-class spectral resolution.",1,,,,,,,,,
The energy resolution of the LAD is driven by three of the five goals (level 1) of the Strong Field Gravity science and these have been used to define the energy resolution requirement.,1,,,,,,,,,
"However, whereas these science goals drive the energy resolution, the combination of spectral resolution with timing resolution (large effective area) will open up a new discovery space and the results of this new discovery space cannot be predicted at this time.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Hence, we have aimed at a design with an ambitious but feasible , but ambitious energy resolution.",1,,,,,,,,,
"As we will show, with CCD-class spectral resolution and passively cooled detectors we can achieve these three science goals.",1,,,,,,,,,
"They will have different resolution but for simplicity we will analyze the data for the full detector and refer to this as ~ 240 eV resolution (“nominal” energy resolution) and study the science impact in the event of a degradation, taking 270 eV and 300 eV as case study (it is useful to here that this is not the degradation in energy resolution associated with the extended field of regard, which is 400 eV).",1,,,,,,,,,
The two main components to the resolution are the intrinsic limiting resolution of Silicon detectors (called Fano noise) and the electronic noise (read-out pre-amplifier and detector leakage current).,1,,,,,,,,,
"A number of other components - including uncertainties in the knowledge of DC noise, gain and offset (see LOFT-IAPS-PLC-MD-0001 for details) - contribute to the resolution but they are of less importance.",1,,,,,,,,,
A degraded spectral resolution will increase the uncertainty on the determination of the centroid (typically by the inverse of the degraded resolution) for a given model.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The extra uncertainty here is statistical (depending also on photons per phase or time-delay bin), rather than systematic (i.e. not being able to distinguish distinct variable spectral components, which are all broad in this case and variable in much longer time scale with respect to the orbital period of the disc).",1,,,,,,,,,
"Thus the increase of the uncertainty can be mitigated by longer observations, with the exposure time scaling roughly with the square of the relative degradation in energy.",1,,,,,,,,,
This has been verified by detailed simulations for an orbiting hot spot and for the reverberation mapping.,1,,,,,,,,,
The fact that the Fe-line is relatively broad and we also fit the broad reflection component confirms this also qualitatively.,1,,,,,,,,,
This argument is only correct if the hot spot lasts long enough to compensate a loss in spectral resolution by longer observations.,1,,,,,,,,,
"However, in case of a hot spot the prime science comes from the variability of the spectra.",1,,,,,,,,,
In this case the complexity and correctness of the model for the emission without hot spot is therefore of less importance.,1,,,,,,,,,
Essentially the same correction can be applied as for the reverberation mapping and tomography case.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The driving requirement is to be able to disentangle all different emission line contributions in the Fe K band (3-8 keV), namely: narrow neutral and ionized lines (Fe Kα, Fe Kβ, Ni Kα) plus broad Fe K line with the goal of determining accurately the broad line parameters to recover the BH's spin.",0,,,,,,,,,
"We worked with AGN, since they will represent the weak, i.e. worst, case scenario.",1,,,,,,,,,
The requirement 240 eV (the expected resolution of single anode events with 200 eV resolution for 40% and shown in the left panel of Fig.,0,,,,,,,,,
"A-2 where the 68, 90 and 99% (black, red and green respectively) confidence levels of the disc inclination vs BH’s spin are given We also mention that all narrow emission line components in the X-ray spectra of AGNs are produced in reprocessing media distant from ~0.1pc to a few pc from the central BH (BLR and molecular torus) and then likely constant over years timescales.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Since we are targeting here bright AGNs, Chandra and XMM already observed all of them allowing characterization of the narrow emission lines.",1,,,,,,,,,
It is also worth noting that Astro-H will observe the AGN LAD sample long enough to characterize with its unprecedented eV precision all narrow components in the Fe K energy range.,1,,,,,,,,,
With the nominal energy response of 240 eV we are able to disentangle all the different line components in the Fe region and get good measurements of the blurred reflection components (continuum and lines).,1,,,,,,,,,
"As an example, starting with BH spin a=0.7, we were able to recover the BH spin at the ~20% level of accuracy, despite the presence of narrow Fe Kα, Fe Kβ, Ni Kα and ionized lines due to a ""hot gas"" emitter with ionization parameter log(xi)~3.5 (see left panel in Fig.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Assuming instead 300 eV FWHM energy resolution for the total of events, we detect some ambiguity in disentangling the different line contributions.",0,,,,,,,,,
"In particular, the ionized lines (Fe XXV/XXVI with equivalent width ~ 40 eV) are blurred together and with the broad line blue wing that prevents the determination of the disc inclination and emissivity with the requested accuracy.",1,,,,,,,,,
This also prevents an accurate spin determination and the error rises to > 50 % (see right panel in Fig.,1,,,,,,,,,
We also check the effect of an intermediately degraded energy resolution (270 eV FWHM).,0,,,,,,,,,
"In this case the scientific objective is still reached, although with a larger uncertainties on the spin determination (typical 99% confidence level at ~40%, see middle panel in Fig.",1,,,,,,,,,
"BH’s spin for different value of the LAD energy resolution: the requirement value (240 eV), degraded (270 eV) and worst case (300 eV).",0,,,,,,,,,
"A-1 including warm absorption, cold reflection and narrow ionized Fe line.",0,,,,,,,,,
We performed a sensitivity analysis of the risks associated with a potential non-compliance of the LAD energy resolution parameter with the requirement.,0,,,,,,,,,
"It has been illustrated that even in the event of an energy resolution not meeting the requirement, consequences for the science objectives can be mitigated by longer observations, with the exception of the Fe-line profile fitting where a 10% spectral resolution degradation is still within the science requirements but a 20% degradation will not meet the requirements.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Of course, this conclusion depends on the assumption that we have a correct understanding and description of the spectra of these sources (and with a better energy resolution this will be verified more easily).",1,,,,,,,,,
In this appendix we give the logic of the requirements flow down.,0,,,,,,,,,
We have taken a number of reasonable assumptions for the balance between the various requirements (which need to be confirmed by the mission design).,0,,,,,,,,,
Below we first present the flow down of the requirements (level 1 to level 2a> This is given in Table B-1 for the LAD and in Table B-2 for the WFM.,0,,,,,,,,,
The flow-down from level 2a to level 2b is given in Table B-4 and finally we list the additional requirements (level 2c) that should not drive the mission design but are nevertheless important to optimize the science output of the mission.,0,,,,,,,,,
The flow down from level 0 to level 1 is omitted for brevity.,1,,,,,,,,,
In addition a number of level 2a requirements follow from the top level goals and the observing plan.,0,,,,,,,,,
A large fraction of the events will take place in the Galactic See observation plan.,0,,,,,,,,,
The actual value is set at 400 eV but could be also somewhat larger (100 eV) before affecting the science significantly.,1,,,,,,,,,
LAD-18 With the proper knowledge on the background (including variations over an orbit) a larger background is acceptable.,1,,,,,,,,,
WFM-08 Allows to combine data from different epochs.,1,,,,,,,,,
Compared to the version 1.6 of the SciRD various requirements have been refined (in substance they were not changed but their definition has been sharpened to avoid misunderstandings).,0,,,,,,,,,
At the same time a few requirements have been dropped as they were obsolete or better captured in a more general formulation.,1,,,,,,,,,
The relevant requirements are given below for traceability.,1,,,,,,,,,
Concept of flat top was dropped and replaced by pointing stability Replaced by a more top level orbit with low background and low radiation Dropped in favor of the more generic requirement.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Likewise there were requirements on redundancy that were defined, but which are not classified as science requirements.",0,,,,,,,,,
Accordingly it was decided that the data rate and other technical issues should be captured in this appendix in order to trace the scientific arguments behind design issues that should instead be reflected in the Experiment Interface Document Annex A.,1,,,,,,,,,
"EChO (Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory) is an M-class mission candidate for the M3 slot within the Cosmic Vision programme, for a planned launch between 2022 and Advisory Committee (SSAC) to enter an assessment study (Phase 0), starting by an ESA internal study followed by parallel industrial study activities.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Within the M3 boundary conditions, the readiness for launch by 2022/2024 is a severe requirement which in practice requires designing the space segment without major technology developments and with minimum developments risks.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, only technologies with estimated Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of at least 5 by the end of the Phase A/B1 (estimated at the end of 2015) may be used.",1,,,,,,,,,
"This document aims at providing a complete and comprehensive list of all high level mission requirements (including S/C and payload, launcher, ground segment and operations) necessary to achieve the science goals detailed in [AD1].",1,,,,,,,,,
It is hence an applicable document that all mission design activities shall comply with.,1,,,,,,,,,
The MRD will be further reviewed matching the results of future study phases (e.g. definition phase) to finally evolve in the System Requirements Document at the start of the implementation phase.,1,,,,,,,,,
Requirements are mandatory and must be complied with.,0,,,,,,,,,
They shall be verified by the Contractor using a verification method approved by ESA.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Goals are desirable in order to maximise the science return while keeping the impact on the cost and complexity to a minimum, but not mandatory.",1,,,,,,,,,
"They are to be the subject of system trade-offs and analysis, and are to be fulfilled under restricted conditions to be defined and quantified.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Requirements are identified by the use of the term “shall”, as opposed to “should” for goals.",1,,,,,,,,,
"X is the requirement type: “R” for a requirement or “G” for a goal YYYY is the requirement category consisting of 2, 3 to 4 letters nnn is the requirement identifier (sequential number of 3 digits).",1,,,,,,,,,
"Each requirement is applicable to either the S/C prime industrial contractor, the instrument consortium or the ground segment (or a combination of these 3).",1,,,,,,,,,

"In addition to those, all ESA approved standards (including relevant ECSS standards) are applicable documents as well.",1,,,,,,,,,
EChO - the Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory – is a survey-type mission dedicated to the characterisation of exoplanetary atmospheres.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Using the differential technique of transit spectroscopy, EChO will obtain transmission and/or emission spectra of the atmospheres of a large and diverse sample of known exoplanets covering a wide range of characteristics.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The instantaneous spectral coverage of EChO is unique in its breadth, spanning the visible to thermal infrared through a series of contiguous spectrometer channels that provide continuous spectral coverage.",1,,,,,,,,,
This broad range opens up the possibility to study exoplanets with physical temperatures ranging from a few hundred to over a few thousand degrees Kelvin.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Importantly, broad instantaneous spectral coverage that includes the visible waveband provides an essential means by which to monitor and subsequently correct for the effects of activity of the host star, which could otherwise introduce significant uncertainty into the final exoplanet spectrum and its interpretation.",1,,,,,,,,,
EChO will observe the combined light from the exoplanet and its host star.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The transit spectroscopy method, whereby the signal from the star and planet are differentiated using knowledge of the planetary ephemerides, allows atmospheric signals from the planet at levels of at least 10-4 relative to the star to be measured.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Photometric stability rather than angular resolution is therefore key, and in fact the most stringent requirement of EChO, driving many engineering design and operational aspects of the mission.",1,,,,,,,,,
For the brightest targets it will be possible to obtain high quality spectra in a single visit, for fainter targets the necessary signal-to-noise will be built up through repeated visits over the mission lifetime.,1,,,,,,,,
EChO will allow scientists to study exoplanets both as a population and as individuals.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The mission will target super-Earths, Neptune-like, and Jupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperatures of 300 K - 3000 K) of F to M-type host stars.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The spectroscopic information (at resolving powers of ≥300 below 5 um and ≥30 above) on the atmospheres of the large, select sample of exoplanets that EChO will provide will allow the compositions, temperature (profile), size and variability to be determined at a level never previously attempted.",1,,,,,,,,,
Do any of the planets observed have habitable conditions?,0,,,,,,,,,
The EChO space segment consists of the Payload module (PLM) and the Service Module (SVM).,0,,,,,,,,,
The SVM holds all the hardware necessary to operate the spacecraft in-orbit and support the payload.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The ground segment provides the means and resources necessary to manage and control the mission via telecommands, to receive and process the telemetry from the satellite, and to disseminate and archive the generated products.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The Mission Operation Centre (MOC) is responsible for the operations of the spacecraft and instruments, for ensuring the spacecraft safety and health, for provision of flight dynamics support including determination and control of the satellite’s orbit and attitude and for provision of data (science and S/C housekeeping) to the Science Operation Centre (SOC).",1,,,,,,,,,

"The scope of the Science Operation Centre (SOC) varies from one mission to another, depending on the scientific organisation of the mission, the responsibilities for each instrument and the partnerships to be put in place.",1,,,,,,,,,
"For EChO, it is anticipated that the core function of the SOC will be the management of the observatory, including planning and scheduling of observations, pointing re-construction, instrument performances follow-up, step-by-step science quality control of observations, pipeline data processing, user support and operation of the science archive.",0,,,,,,,,,
Several of these activities will be done in conjunction with an Instrument Operations and Science Data Centre (IOSDC).,0,,,,,,,,,
"The launcher refers here not only to the launch vehicle, but also to the means and facilities made available on site for the spacecraft preparation, fuelling (if any), encapsulation and launch operations.",0,,,,,,,,,
It is considered as a component of the system until the LV – S/C separation.,0,,,,,,,,,
"In addition, all of these sub-components of the EChO system also include EChO specific ground support equipment (e.g. equipment at the launch site facility, AIV and test facilities equipment etc.).",0,,,,,,,,,
The S/C is composed of a SVM and PLM which are thermally de-coupled.,0,,,,,,,,,
"In-orbit around the Sun-Earth L2 point for optimum thermo-mechanical stability, the EChO S/C will point at known transiting exoplanets distributed over the sky, with an expected bias towards targets closer to the ecliptic poles.",1,,,,,,,,,
"This will enable an uninterrupted observation of the transits of these targets over longer periods of times within each year, as well as reducing the noise generated by the zodiacal background.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The baseline payload consist of an off-axis afocal telescope, accommodated horizontally on the SVM.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The telescope feeds a single science instrument, covering the complete wave range using dichroic mirrors to split the band into several channels.",1,,,,,,,,,

Although in the science programme the baseline launch slot for M3 is decision on the nominal launch date will be made following JUICE mission adoption.,1,,,,,,,,,
The baseline injection strategy shall be to place the EChO S/C in an eclipse-free (Earth and Moon) direct transfer trajectory to the Sun-Earth L2 point.,0,,,,,,,,,
"In practice, this requirement with MR-MIS-040 means that there are daily launch windows between 14h and 15h30, apart from a ~1 month period around both equinoxes.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The LEOP phase shall be from launch to the end of the 1st manoeuvre for launcher dispersion correction, occurring no later than 2 days after the LV – S/C separation.",0,,,,,,,,,
The S/C shall autonomously detect separation from the LV.,0,,,,,,,,,
"MR-MIS-100 After separation from the LV, the S/C shall autonomously activate one of its transmitting channels and its 2 receiving channels to allow the ESA ground station network to establish the first contact.",1,,,,,,,,,
"This manoeuvre is an attitude correction manoeuvre, not the 1st orbital correction manoeuvre defined in MR-MIS-070.",0,,,,,,,,,
The instrument performance verification and science demonstration phase shall be completed within 6 months of the LV – S/C separation.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Although it will take about 1 month to arrive at a point 1.5 million km away from Earth, it will take about another 2 months before the amplitude and angle conditions expressed in MR-MIS-040 are verified.",1,,,,,,,,,
The post operations phase shall start from the end of the extended science operations phase and last for 2 years (TBC).,1,,,,,,,,,
"In the case that there is no extended science operations phase, the post operations phase shall start at the end of the nominal science operations phases.",1,,,,,,,,,
The decommissioning phase shall ensure compliance with the Space Debris Mitigation for Agency Projects [AD10].,0,,,,,,,,,
"The nominal mission lifetime, from LV (upper-stage) separation to the end of the nominal science operations phase, shall have a duration of 4 years.",1,,,,,,,,,
This margin accounts for e.g. possible launch delays or late deliveries of specific units.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Following margins defined by MR-SYS-020 (i.e. [AD3] R-DV-1), 5% are to be added to the delta-Vs above, apart for the 50 m/s for de- commissioning (no additional margin needed).",0,,,,,,,,,
This mode will ensure science operations can be re-initiated “quickly” (e.g. within few hours) when needed.,1,,,,,,,,,
Other instrument units (e.g. detectors and ICU) can be kept on if justified.,0,,,,,,,,,
The pointing stability between the instrument LoS and the science target with the FGS in the control loop shall be controlled to ensure compliance with the noise and photometric stability requirement MR-PERF-350.,1,,,,,,,,,
The maximum angular motion of these targets is 10 arcsec/min.,0,,,,,,,,,
A de-contamination mode shall ensure out-gassing and moisture release does not degrade the mission performance at any point during the mission.,1,,,,,,,,,
"This mode is necessary during LEOP and transfer to L2 to prevent contamination of the telescope and focal plane detectors during the initial out-gassing and moisture release of the S/C, but can also be re-used later during the mission lifetime to clean these units from any contaminants that might have accumulated since.",1,,,,,,,,,

"The rotation around XECHO is not a science need, it is only a safety margin that includes the Sun diameter.",0,,,,,,,,,
MR-PERF-061 Corruption or loss of science data during a science observation shall be deducted from the observation efficiency budget with a degradation factor of 2.,1,,,,,,,,,
This loss can be due to e.g. reaction wheel spikes etc.,1,,,,,,,,,
The degradation factor is needed since a loss of X seconds during an observation out of transit means the equivalent X seconds in transit needed for the differential measurement are also lost.,1,,,,,,,,,
"MR-PERF-070 An average observation shall be defined as the observation of a single science target for 3.7 hours, separated by 90 degrees from the previous and the next science targets (TBC).",1,,,,,,,,,
"For example, the Airy disk is 0.34’’, assuming a cut-off wavelength of 0.8 μm and a 1.2 m diameter telescope.",0,,,,,,,,,

The zodiacal background contribution shall be evaluated using a worst case FoV per spectral bin of 10’’x10’’ (TBC) and the average zodi value as defined in MR- PERF-390.,1,,,,,,,,,
These values has been derived using the performance parameters defined equivalent relaxation to the noise requirement would be acceptable.,1,,,,,,,,,
This noise definition is extensively detailed in [AD2].,0,,,,,,,,,
From 60 s (2x goal temporal sampling) to 3 days (to enable orbital phase measurements).,0,,,,,,,,,
Observation of stars with neighbouring sources that make a larger contribution is TBD.,1,,,,,,,,,
This means no additional budget needs to be apportioned to neighbouring sources in the total noise budget.,1,,,,,,,,,

The SI international system of units shall be used.,0,,,,,,,,,

"Doppler tracking can be done simultaneously with ranging or science TM, but ranging cannot be done simultaneously with science TM.",1,,,,,,,,,
"In addition, Doppler tracking and ranging can be achieved with LGAs, but science TM requires a HGA.",1,,,,,,,,,

"LOFT, with 3 other science missions, was recommended by the Space Science Advisory Committee (SSAC) to enter an assessment study (Phase 0), starting by an ESA internal study followed by parallel industrial study activities.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Within the M3 boundary conditions, the readiness for launch by end 2022/2024 is a severe requirement which in practice requires designing the space segment without major technology developments and with minimum developments risks.",1,,,,,,,,,

The region of the sky where the LAD can be pointed to continuously for at least 1 orbit (disregarding a potential temporal occultation of the target by the Earth) guaranteeing the LAD nominal energy resolution [R-PERF-100] and nominal response stability at any time during the mission.,1,,,,,,,,,
The region of the sky where the LAD can be pointed to continuously for at least 1 orbit (disregarding a potential temporal occultation of the target by the Earth) guaranteeing the LAD degraded energy resolution [R-PERF-101] and nominal response stability at any time during the mission.,1,,,,,,,,,
The LOFT convention when discussing the LAD Field of Regard is to work from the reference position of the SC when the boresight of the LAD is orthogonal to the Sun-line (i.e. LAD SAA=90°).,1,,,,,,,,,
"The Field of Regard is then expressed as a ± deviation from this position, e.g. the Nominal Field of Regard of 50% of the sky is written as 90°±30°.",1,,,,,,,,,

"LOFT is intended to answer fundamental questions about the motion of matter orbiting close to the event horizon of a black hole, and the state of matter in neutron stars, by detecting their very rapid X-ray flux and spectral variability.",1,,,,,,,,,
"LOFT would carry two instruments: a Large Area Detector (LAD) with an effective area (around 10 m^2) far larger than current space-borne X-ray detectors, and a Wide Field Monitor (WFM) that would monitor a large portion of the sky to provide interesting targets for follow-up observations with the LAD, and also to provide a rapid burst-alert function (via the LOFT Burst Alert System – LBAS) to the broader x-ray astronomy community.",0,,,,,,,,,
"High-time-resolution X-ray observations of compact objects provide direct access to strong-field gravity, black hole masses and spins, and the equation of state of ultra-dense matter.",1,,,,,,,,,
What is the equation of state of matter in neutron stars?,0,,,,,,,,,
"Due to an innovative design and the development of large monolithic silicon drift detectors, the Large Area Detector (LAD) on board LOFT will achieve an effective area of ~10 m^2 (more than an order of magnitude larger than current space-borne X-ray detectors) in the 2-30 keV range (up to 80 keV in expanded mode).",1,,,,,,,,,
"With this large area and a nominal spectral resolution of <260 eV over the entire band, LOFT will revolutionise the study of collapsed objects in our galaxy and of the brightest supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei, yielding unprecedented information on strongly curved space-times and matter under extreme conditions of pressure and magnetic field strength.",1,,,,,,,,,
"In addition to these core science goals, LOFT will provide a 50% allocation of the observing time to observatory science.",0,,,,,,,,,
"This, combined with the burst-alert function, means that LOFT will provide an extremely valuable resource to the x-ray astronomy community.",1,,,,,,,,,
The scientific objectives are be achieved through the measurement of the X-ray photometric light curves and spectra of a range of different astrophysical target classes.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The targets are all compact objects (neutron stars, black holes and AGN) therefore the measurement requires no imaging capability.",1,,,,,,,,,
Targets will be selected by a pointing a collimating structure that discriminates the required source from the background of diffuse or nearby X-ray emitting sources.,1,,,,,,,,,
"A large effective collecting area ensures that sufficient photons can be collected to accumulate spectra and precision photometry, over the variability time scales of interest for the different target classes.",1,,,,,,,,,
"A complementary measurement will take place to monitor a large fraction of the instantaneously visible sky for transients and outbursts that allows for Targets of Opportunity, as well as long term source monitoring.",1,,,,,,,,,
"This measurement is enabled by a coded mask imaging technique, providing time- and energy sliced images of the available field of view, as well as spectra and light curves of busts and transients.",1,,,,,,,,,
The LOFT space segment consists of the Payload module (PLM) and the Service Module (SVM).,0,,,,,,,,,

This appendix provides traceability for those science requirements which have been transformed or allocated into spacecraft requirements.,,0,,,,,,,,
"In each of these cases, the format declares the relevant MRD requirement, the parent SciRD requirement(s), and a brief justification text for the MRD requirement, with references to supporting documentation as appropriate.",,1,,,,,,,,
There are 2 separate science requirements that impact on required science mission lifetime.,,0,,,,,,,,
"These are unpredictable and rare events, with frequency of occurrence within an observable field of regard that can only be roughly estimated from previous experience (e.g. RXTE).",,0,,,,,,,,
This is then comparable and consistent with the estimation of time needed for an overall observing programme.,,0,,,,,,,,
"For example for the range of object classes, and targets per class, to be observed in order to fulfil the top level science goals, a total of ~20Ms observing time is required.",,1,,,,,,,,
"However these observations must be spread over extended “campaigns” to observe objects in appropriate emission states, and furthermore some objects in nearby regions of sky cannot be observed simultaneously.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Hence, given some baseline estimate of observing efficiency the 20Ms observing time must be spread out, with an estimate of +/- 4 years again resulting from initial simulation work.",,1,,,,,,,,
Extended operations [G-MIS-150] naturally follows from providing margins on the above arguments for greater security in completing the core science observing aims.,,0,,,,,,,,
In 5400 days (15 yrs) RXTE observed 17 big or major (very big) outbursts of 11 BH transient sources.,,0,,,,,,,,
We have taken those outbursts where the accretion state occurs during which the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation was detected with RXTE/PCA.,,0,,,,,,,,
In 4 years you have a probability of covering at least one of these outbursts of 98%.,,0,,,,,,,,
"In 4 years the probability to get 2 major outbursts is 90%, to get 3 is 74%.",,0,,,,,,,,
The RXTE rate of new AMXP discoveries is 13/15=0.87/yr.,,0,,,,,,,,
"These outbursts are brief so RXTE misses 10% of them, and LOFT will see less due to the reduced accessible sky fraction when compare with RXTE.",,1,,,,,,,,
"It is important to understand that prob=f(FoR, duration), so failure to meet FoR or mission duration requirements will necessitate re-evaluation of the satisfaction of these requirements.",,0,,,,,,,,
The choice of orbit for LOFT is strongly influenced by the requirement to minimise the instrument background - furthermore for reasons of reducing systematic effects due an unstable background (contributing to background knowledge error) the orbit must be chosen to avoid regions intersecting known enhancements of charged particles.,,0,,,,,,,,
"See [RD 10] which demonstrates that for the specified range of orbits, the LAD background and background knowledge are suppressed to acceptable levels.",,0,,,,,,,,
"In addition to the mean background rate, it should remain as much as possible stable.",,0,,,,,,,,
"While the background will be periodically monitored by pointing to selected fields containing no bright sources, the variation between an observation and a reference field must be minimised.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Effects such as geomagnetic shielding of the primary cosmic rays, and the solid angle for accepting atmospheric albedo neutrons may be compounded by the variability in orbital charged particle populations.",,0,,,,,,,,
Therefore maintaining a circular orbit will minimise the variability of such components.,,1,,,,,,,,
The energy resolution of the SDD is a function of the bulk leakage current – this is influenced primarily by (i) accumulated radiation damage and (ii) temperature.,,0,,,,,,,,
LAD/WFM SDD detectors in support of their energy resolution requirements.,,0,,,,,,,,
Two types of radiation damage are generally encountered by silicon devices: bulk damage and surface damage.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The surface damage is related to the increase of the fixed oxide charge, and the production of trapping holes in the Si-SiO2 interface and is quantified by the Total Ionizing Dose (TID).",,0,,,,,,,,
"The bulk damage, i.e. the displacement of the Si atoms from their lattice sites that creates additional energy levels within the band gap, producing a variation of the effective bulk doping and increasing the leakage current, is quantified by the Non Ionizing Energy Losses (NIEL).",,0,,,,,,,,
"Because active thermal control (cooling) of the LAD array is not feasible (because of its very large area), it is necessary to target a LEO orbit at low inclination, to minimise the radiation dose seen by the detectors, and accordingly to relax the detector temperature requirements to achievable values.",,1,,,,,,,,
See [RD 11] for a full description of the modelling of the detector damage for the candidate range of orbits for LOFT – this document provides the resulting maximum allowable detector temperatures which provide the required energy resolution.,,0,,,,,,,,
Also see [RD 12] for initial test results on radiation damage tests to the SDDs which supports the assumptions made in [RD 11].,,0,,,,,,,,
"Given the other important system-level factors to consider when selecting the baseline orbit (launcher performance, orbit maintenance dV requirements, GS contact times…), the MRD requirement has been expressed as a range, within which the baseline can be freely selected by the System Prime (to first-order the T/O is between required detector temperature and fuel required for orbit maintenance).",,1,,,,,,,,
"The temperatures specified in the MRD requirements on energy resolution are derived from [RD 11] which describes the modelling of the SDD radiation damage, and resulting increase in leakage current, for the candidate range of orbits for LOFT – this document provides the resulting maximum allowable detector temperatures which provide the required energy resolution, for the range of candidate orbits.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Given the other important system-level factors to consider at LEO (launcher performance, orbit maintenance dV requirements, GS contact times etc…), the MRD requirements have been expressed as a range, within which the baseline can be freely selected by the System Prime (to first-order the trade-off is between required detector temperature and fuel required for orbit maintenance).",,1,,,,,,,,
The variation of the LAD effective area will modulate the count-rate seen by the instrument – this must be limited to ensure that distortion of the core astrophysical signals of interest is kept down to levels that are acceptable in the view of the statistical quality with which they will be measured.,,1,,,,,,,,
"A statement has been received from the LOFT consortium that, after calibration, the residual error in the WFM camera is of the order of ~arcseconds.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Accordingly an initial allocation has been made of 10’’ to the WFM instrument, with the remaining 50’’ allocated to the SC, up until the mechanical I/F with each WFM camera.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The LOFT consortium is in the process of developing a WFM source-localisation budget, within which the platform contribution shall be placed.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The LAD scientific telemetry budget is estimated assuming default event-by-event data transmission, 24-bit per event.",,0,,,,,,,,
We conservatively assume a source with intensity 500 mCrab in the field of view at any time (this flux threshold includes >95% of the known X-ray sources with flux above 1 mCrab).,,0,,,,,,,,
"The expected count rate under the assumption is ~117 000 cts/s, in addition to the expected ~3000 cts s-1 from the background.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Preliminary simulations have been carried out using simulated LAD data streams and standard compression algorithms (gzip, bzip2, 7Z(PMMd), ZPAQ, PAQ8l), providing compression factors up to ~2.1.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, adopting lossless algorithms for space applications (e.g., Rice compression) we assume that a 2 compression factor is affordable.",,1,,,,,,,,
The required computational resources are being evaluated as well.,,0,,,,,,,,
A 64 GB mass memory on the DHU will allow the temporary storage of excess telemetry.,,1,,,,,,,,
Some of the key science targets (~10 persistent sources and some bright X-ray transients) will have average LAD count rate above 1.2x105 cts s-1.,,0,,,,,,,,
"In these cases we will employ a flexible set of data modes, as was done with the Event Data System (EDS) on RossiXTE.",,1,,,,,,,,
These modes allow the time and energy binning to be optimized for the science goals within the available telemetry budget.,,1,,,,,,,,
"The observing plan will be optimized by alternating bright and weak sources to allow for a gradual download of the excess telemetry, a strategy already successfully adopted by the RossiXTE/PCA.",,0,,,,,,,,
See [RD 13] for a simulation of LAD telemetry generation and downlink.,,0,,,,,,,,
See [RD 14] for an analysis of the WFM instrument TM generation within the ~100kbps allocation.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The LAD observations require co-addition of data taken by the >28,000 detector channels composing the detector, reaching the required energy resolution.",,1,,,,,,,,
This implies that any differences in the response of the ASICs is known with sufficient accuracy so as not to introduce worsening of the energy resolution due to different gains of the circuitry.,,1,,,,,,,,
"As this is known to depend on the temperature, we initially fixed a cautionary requirement on the maximum temperature variation across the instrument (5C) and during an observation (stability).",,0,,,,,,,,
"In addition there is planned a linear on-board correction to the event amplitude, based on a set of pre-loaded look-up tables providing the linear coefficients of the off-set and gain of the ASICs as a function of temperatures, within the operative range.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The tables will be built during the thermal tests on the ground, by using the fast and effective electrical calibration procedure, allowing to inject know charges into all pre-amp channels and get the response with high statistical accuracy (the test capacitor will be in turn calibrated against X-rays on the ground with the required statistical accuracy, as planned).",,0,,,,,,,,
The electrical calibration can also be repeated and benchmarked in orbit.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Of course, the concept of temperature correction implies that for every detected photon an equilibrium temperature can be defined and used for correction (i.e., T variations should not be “too fast”).",,0,,,,,,,,
On January 2013 the first LAD ASIC prototype was made available at IRAP and temperature tests were carried out.,,0,,,,,,,,
These tests show a much better thermal stability of the gain under this design than the one used as early reference.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The analysis, reported in LAD_TempReq_v2 (22.01.2013) by F. Muleri et al., shows that with the LAD ASIC the energy resolution is affected by less than the required 1% over the full temperature range even without the application of the linear gain correction.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Based on this result, the temperature stability requirements of the LAD can be much relaxed in comparison to the previous specification.",,0,,,,,,,,
We maintain the on-board linear gain correction approach for robustness.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The above requirements concern only gradients and stability, under the assumption that the absolute T value is in-spec, guaranteeing the required energy resolution.",,0,,,,,,,,

"Theory of General Relativity, as well as numerous other alternative or more general theories of gravitation, are classical theories.",,0,,,,,,,,

The mission will also have the capability to perform Lorentz Invariance and Standard Model Extension (SME) tests.,,0,,,,,,,,
The accuracy levels achievable in these tests are currently under evaluation.,,0,,,,,,,,
Test the universality of the free propagation of matter waves to an uncertainty in the Eötvös parameter better than 1.5x10-15.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The ground track can be optimised to maximise visibility at the STE-QUEST ground stations, which may be located in Boulder (USA), Turin (Italy), and Tokyo (Japan).",,0,,,,,,,,
These locations are particularly favourable because of their geographical distributions and vicinity to research laboratories operating highly stable and accurate atomic clocks.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Centres for instrument operations and data analysis, respectively.",,0,,,,,,,,
Close monitoring of the spacecraft will be necessary during the on-orbit characterisation phase which is expected to last for the first 6 months of the mission.,,0,,,,,,,,
The estimated data volume is compatible with small ESOC ground stations.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Space-to-ground clock comparisons will be performed all along the orbit, and in particular, while the spacecraft is at apogee and perigee.",,0,,,,,,,,
"In this way, Einstein's prediction of the gravitational frequency shift will be verified both by an absolute measurement between space and ground clocks and by examining the modulation of the redshift effect on the STE-QUEST clock between perigee and apogee.",,0,,,,,,,,
"STE-QUEST will also allow common-view comparison of terrestrial clocks, which can be used to measure the periodic effect of the gravitational frequency shift induced by the Sun.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The atom interferometer will primarily perform differential acceleration measurements while the spacecraft is around perigee (spacecraft altitude below 3000 kilometres), thus maximising the signal-to-noise ratio of a possible violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle.",,1,,,,,,,,
A direct consequence of Einstein's Equivalence Principle is that time passes (or clocks tick) more slowly near a massive body.,,0,,,,,,,,
"This effect can be detected when comparing the time intervals measured by identical clocks placed at different positions in a gravitational field, or when their tick rates (frequencies) are compared.",,1,,,,,,,,
Time and frequency can be transferred between remote locations using electromagnetic waves generated directly from the local clock and transmitted to a particular detection position (ded by x').,,0,,,,,,,,
"In this gravitational redshift formula, νi(x') is the frequency of clock i located at xi, as observed (measured) at the particular location x' where the comparison between the two clocks takes place (see Figure below); U is the gravitational potential.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Theory of General Relativity, this frequency ratio is universal, and independent of the nature of the clocks.",,0,,,,,,,,
The link transfers the clock signals in both directions (space-to-ground and ground-to-space) allowing the received signal to be compared with the local clock at both ends.,,1,,,,,,,,
STE-QUEST will search for a possible violation of the gravitational redshift formula.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Phenomenologically, such a violation may be described by a dependence on the gravitational potential of one or more of the fundamental constants that determine the clock frequency: X = X(U l c²), where X is a generic dimensionless fundamental constant or a dimensionless combination of fundamental constants.",,0,,,,,,,,
Such dependence would correspond to a violation of the Local Position Invariance principle (LPI).,,0,,,,,,,,

This will provide a means to search for the neutron’s scalar charge and to test the anomalous coupling of matter to the Standard Model quantum fields.,,0,,,,,,,,
The Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) postulates that the world line of a freely falling test body is independent of its structure and composition.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Theory of General Relativity, but also for almost all modern theories of gravitation.",,0,,,,,,,,
Experimental tests of this principle are therefore based on the detection of tiny differential accelerations between test masses of different structure and composition.,,1,,,,,,,,
An experiment measuring a value of η not equal to zero would disprove the universality of free fall and violate the Equivalence Principle.,,0,,,,,,,,
"In tracking the free propagation of matter waves, free-fall experiments extend into the domain of quantum objects.",,0,,,,,,,,
This approach is conceptually different from all other free-fall tests based on classical bodies.,,0,,,,,,,,

An introduction and overview of the mission based on the science case is provided in Section 2.,,0,,,,,,,,
In Section 3 we present the science objectives and the implied top level science requirements.,,0,,,,,,,,
"We try to follow the scheme “objective → method → requirement”, whereby requirement is always at the contents.",,0,,,,,,,,
The numbering of the requirements facilitates later discussions and change control.,,1,,,,,,,,
Section 4 contains the technical requirements for payload and mission.,,0,,,,,,,,
These requirements are derived from the top level requirements.,,0,,,,,,,,
"With Issue 0/4 of this document, we have removed all text and requirements related to the slit spectroscopy option.",,0,,,,,,,,
"This option has been considered during the assessment phase, but was deemed infeasible in the framework of an M-Class Cosmic Visions mission.",,1,,,,,,,,
Several independent observations indicate that the cosmological expansion began to accelerate when the universe was around half of its present age.,,1,,,,,,,,
"This conclusion assumes the correctness of General Relativity, and requires that the universe must contain a new component known as dark energy.",,1,,,,,,,,
"As a surprising consequence, the dark energy contributes to 76% of the total energy density of the universe, while the contribution of baryonic matter is only 4%.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The remaining 20% is com- posed of dark matter, which, just as dark energy, has no explanation in standard physical theory.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Like the accelerated expansion which took place during the early epoch of our universe, commonly known as “inflation”, the present acceleration leaves imprints on the different phases of the expansion of the Universe.",,0,,,,,,,,
"At the same time, the growth of structures in the Universe is sensitive to the details of the acceleration process, but also to the very nature of the force of gravity, a modification of which might be the alternative explanation of the apparent acceleration.",,0,,,,,,,,
The equa- tion of state of dark energy can thus be constrained from observations of the expansion history of the universe throughout its visible epoch since the decoupling of the microwave background.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Com- plementary, the need for a new theory of gravity can be either ruled out or confirmed from observations of the growth of large scale structure in the Universe.",,0,,,,,,,,
Euclid is an ESA mission to map the geometry of the dark Universe.,,0,,,,,,,,
The survey mission will investigate the distance-redshift relationship and the evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and redshifts of galaxies and clusters of galaxies.,,0,,,,,,,,
The statistical study of structures in a large volume of the Universe requires a survey of a large fraction of the extragalactic sky.,,1,,,,,,,,
Euclid will address key fundamental cosmological questions.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Is dark energy merely a cosmological constant, as first discussed by Einstein, or is it a new kind of field that evolves dynamically with the expansion of the universe?",,0,,,,,,,,
"Alternatively, is dark energy instead a manifestation of a break-down of General Relativity and deviations from the law of gravity?",,0,,,,,,,,
What are the initial conditions which seed the formation of cosmic structure?,,0,,,,,,,,
"The mission is centred on weak lensing and baryonic acoustic oscillations, two powerful and robust probes of the dark Universe.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The mission also incorporates other cosmological probes such as galaxy cluster statistics, the integrated Sachs Wolfe effect, and the redshift-space distortions.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Beyond these breakthroughs in fundamental cosmology, the Euclid surveys will provide unique legacy science in various fields of astrophysics.",,0,,,,,,,,
"In the area of galaxy evolution and formation, Euclid will deliver high quality morphologies, masses, and star-formation rates for billions of galaxies out to z~2, over the entire extra-galactic sky, with a resolution 4 times better and 3 NIR magnitudes deeper than ground based surveys.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The Euclid deep survey will probe the ‘dark ages’ of galaxy formation as it is predicted to find thousands of galaxies at z>6, of which about 100 could be at z>10, i.e. probing the era of reionization of the Universe.",,0,,,,,,,,
"With Euclid, the majority of the new sources identified by future imaging observatories, from radio to X-rays, will be readily associated to a known redshift, out to a redshift z~2.",,0,,,,,,,,
"This adds an enormous power to the science return of these other projects, as it eliminates the time-consuming phase of redshift follow-up.",,1,,,,,,,,
Euclid will measure the distance-redshift relation and the growth of structure by optimizing its instrumentation and observing strategy to two complementary dark energy probing methods.,,0,,,,,,,,
The weak gravitational lensing (WL) method relies on the fact that the distribution of mass along the line of sight distorts the apparent shapes and orientation of galaxies.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The matter distribution, and hence cosmological structures, is obtained from the inferred gravitational field causing the weak lensing.",,1,,,,,,,,
This provides a measurement of the effect of dark energy both the geometry and the growth of structure.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) method relies on the distribution of baryonic matter, i.e. a galaxy redshift survey, to infer the redshift-distance relation.",,0,,,,,,,,
The characteristic scale length of structure which can be accurately determined from the cosmic microwave background is used as a standard rod.,,0,,,,,,,,
"By measuring this characteristic scale in the galaxy power spectrum (or correlation function) as a function of redshift both in the tangential and redshift directions, one directly probes the expansion history H(z) and thus the equation of state of dark energy w(z).",,1,,,,,,,,
"At the same time, the statistical distortion of the clustering pattern is a direct consequence of the growth of structure.",,1,,,,,,,,
The science concept of Euclid relies on the fact that the combined results of the two principal me- thods provide very strong constraints on the dark energy equation of state and enable to sort out systematic uncertainties and biases that are inherent to each of the individual probes (Sect 3.1.1.2).,,0,,,,,,,,
"Besides the two principal probes for which the mission is optimized, other DE probes can also be addressed with the Euclid survey and will provide additional constraints on the DE equation of state.",,0,,,,,,,,
A list of the Euclid DE probes is given in Table 2.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Observing from space provides a well-controlled environment and avoids sources of systematic errors caused by the Earth’s atmosphere and thermal variations, which seriously limits similar observations from ground.",,0,,,,,,,,
This will give an unprecedented improvement in the dark energy characterisation in comparison to what can be achieved from ground only.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The Euclid survey will produce a visible image of a large fraction of the extra-galactic sky (20,000 deg2) at a diffraction limited spatial resolution not possible from ground, and near-infrared (NIR) images in one or more bands of the same area.",,0,,,,,,,,
The sky coverage and depth in NIR photometry cannot be achieved from ground due to the high background emission from the atmosphere.,,1,,,,,,,,
Euclid will also yield medium resolution (R=500) spectra of about a third of all galaxies brighter than the minimum limiting magnitude of H(AB) = 19.5 mag or with emission line Hα flux of 4×10- difficult to access from ground for faint galaxies at 1<z<2 due to the high background emission from the atmosphere.,,1,,,,,,,,
"In addition, the high number of atmospheric sky lines requires a higher spectral resolution for a ground based experiment to obtain the same redshift accuracy from space.",,0,,,,,,,,
"This means that each ground-based spectrum would be much bigger on the detector, thus making a massive redshift survey as Euclid unfeasible from the ground.",,1,,,,,,,,
The spacecraft will be placed in a large L2 orbit which will ensure stable thermal and observing conditions.,,1,,,,,,,,
The satellite will be launched on a Soyouz ST-2.1B rocket from Kourou.,,0,,,,,,,,
The nominal mission duration is 5 years and the observations will be done in step-and-stare mode.,,0,,,,,,,,
Image dithering will be achieved at spacecraft level to fill detector gaps and allow correction for cosmic rays.,,0,,,,,,,,
A fine guidance system will provide a relative pointing accuracy of 35mas over one dither exposure of ~500s.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Euclid’s primary wide survey will cover 20,000 deg2, i.e. the entire extragalactic sky, thus measuring shapes and redshifts of galaxies to redshift 2 as required for WL and BAO.",,1,,,,,,,,
"For weak lensing, Euclid will measure the shape of over 2 billion galaxies with a density of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm) down to AB mag 24.5 (10, extended object).",,0,,,,,,,,
"The photometric redshifts for these galaxies will reach a precision of σz/(1+z)= the range 0.92-2.0 micron) reaching AB mag 24 (5, point source) in each, complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived through engaged collaborations with ground based projects.",,0,,,,,,,,
To measure the shear from the galaxy ellipticities a tight control is imposed on possible instrumental effects and will lead to the variance of the shear systematic errors to be less than 10–7.,,1,,,,,,,,
The BAO are determined from a spectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy of σz/(1+z) ≤0.001.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The Euclid baseline is a slitless spectrometer with constant λ/Δλ=500, which will detect predominantly Hα emission line galaxies.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The limiting line flux level is 4×10-16 erg s1cm2 (point source 7σ at 1.6 micron), yielding 70 million galaxy redshifts with a success rate in excess of redshifts can be determined.",,0,,,,,,,,
Euclid’s additional deep survey will cover 40 deg2.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The primary science outcome of Euclid will be the detailed testing of the current standard cosmolo- gical model against the largest feasible observational data sets, with the specific objective of cha- racterising the nature of the Dark Energy based on the combined results of the WL and BAO measurements.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Euclid will yield a unique and vast data legacy which is expected to have a large discovery potential in several fields of cosmology, extra-galactic and galactic astrophysics.",,0,,,,,,,,
This legacy is seen as a very important all encompassing science objective.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The properties of dark energy can be quantified by considering its equation of state parameter w=p/ρc2, where p and ρ are its effective pressure and density.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Translating from linear time to observable redshift z, we can parameterize the DE state parameter w(z) = w0+wa(1a), with a=1/(1+z) is the scale factor.",,0,,,,,,,,
The parameters w0 and wa are the present value and the rate of change of the DE state parameter.,,0,,,,,,,,
"With this form, the errors on wp and wa become uncorrelated and the error on wp corresponds to the error we would measure for a constant w model.",,0,,,,,,,,
By combining all current surveys its value is FoMDE ~ 10 (Komatsu et al.,,0,,,,,,,,
"As well as the geometry, dark energy also affects the growth of structure.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The expansion of the Universe acts as a damping term for the growth of density fluctuation so as the expansion rate increases, the growth of structure slows down.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Importantly, however, the growth rate f(a) depends also on the gravity theory, which makes it a fundamental probe of modified gravity (see next section).",,0,,,,,,,,
"In the GR framework, measurements of f(a) represent a fundamental consistency test of our cosmological assumptions, while carrying additional information on w(a) beyond the geometric probes of the expansion rate.",,0,,,,,,,,
The Euclid mission is designed to address all the sectors of the standard cosmological model.,,0,,,,,,,,

"Measure the growth index, γm, to a precision better than 2%.",,0,,,,,,,,
A number of cosmological probes have been put forward for measuring the properties of dark energy.,,0,,,,,,,,
"In both reports of the DETF [RD08] and the ESA/ESO Working Group on Fundamental Cosmology (WGFC, [RD09]), the four main probes of dark energy are identified as: (i) weak lensing; (ii) galaxy redshift surveys (needed for the BAO measurement); (iii) Type Ia supernova measurements; and (iv) galaxy cluster counts.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Other methods are also briefly discussed, but of the four main techniques, weak lensing and galaxy redshift surveys form a unique combination for As stand alone probes, these are the two most powerful measures of dark energy.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, as well as having the smallest error bars on the equation of state parameter (w), each one of these two probes is able to place strong constraints on both geometry and structure formation.",,0,,,,,,,,
The combination of these two probes allows us to control and measure a wide range of systematics.,,1,,,,,,,,
"In particular the cross correlation between these two probes allows us to measure and mitigate astrophysical systematics, notably intrinsic alignments for weak lensing and galaxy bias for galaxy redshift surveys.",,1,,,,,,,,
"As well as breaking degeneracies in parameter space, a joint weak lensing and spectroscopic galaxy survey analysis is able to measure both Newtonian potentials, φ(k,z) and ψ(k,z), which describe the scalar (density) perturbations in a perturbed LFRW Universe, in order to provide constraints on modified gravity theories.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Conventional wisdom in the dark energy community, which is emphasized in both the DETF and ESA/ESA WGFC reports, is that high precision and accurate measurements will require a combi- nation of two or more probes.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Euclid is such a mission, making it the most promising dark energy probes of any being designed.",,0,,,,,,,,
"According to Euclid’s first primary science objective (Table 1), the Figure of Merit (FoM) of the combination will be at least 500, which is 10-20 times higher than a DETF Stage II experiment, making Euclid at least a Stage IV experiment in the DETF scale.",,1,,,,,,,,

"In order to achieve the scien- tific objectives of Euclid as listed in Table 1, which require a FoM in excess of 500, the survey area of the WL and BAO surveys needs to cover a large fraction of the extragalactic sky of 20 000 deg2.",,1,,,,,,,,
The Weak Lensing survey involves the measurement of (1) the galaxy shear from the shapes of galaxies down to a limiting magnitude and (2) the corresponding redshift of each galaxy.,,0,,,,,,,,
The galaxy shear is measured in the visible by obtaining diffraction limited images from space.,,0,,,,,,,,
Multi band photometry is employed to obtain the photometric redshift or “photo-z”.,,0,,,,,,,,
"To achieve the best photo-z accuracy for the required redshift binning, the Euclid WL experiment relies on com- plementary ground based photometry in visible bands derived through engaged collaborations with ground based projects.",,1,,,,,,,,
The inclusion of these data is an integral part of the Euclid mission design.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The WL survey will address the four primary science objectives as listed in the previous section (Table 1), according to the specified precisions.",,0,,,,,,,,
The WL survey will also form the basis for the measurement of mass-selected cluster counts and the measurement of the ISW effect through a cross-correlation with the Cosmic Microwave Background measurement from WMAP and Planck.,,0,,,,,,,,

"The same dataset will allow probing, for free, the formation and evolution of galaxies with unprecedented statistical significance.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The WL survey shall cover at least 20,000 deg2 (or 2π sr) and provide 30 galaxies per arcmin2 (required, 40 galaxies per arcmin, goal) usable for WL with a median redshift zm>0.8 (required, zm>1.0, goal).",,0,,,,,,,,
"This requirement is essential to achieve the target accuracy on cosmological parameters, especially to achieve ~1% error on w. It results from trade-off studies aimed at the optimisation of the survey configuration to minimise the errors on dark energy parameters [RD02].",,1,,,,,,,,
The errors depend on both the area of the survey and the number of galaxies.,,0,,,,,,,,
The requirement can only be fulfilled if the extragalactic sky is covered at high galactic latitudes with b≥30 deg.,,1,,,,,,,,
Requirement: Systematic effects shall be controlled to a level where they do not dominate over the statistical errors.,,0,,,,,,,,
"This is accomplished if the variance of the residual shear systematics is controlled This requirement is essential for the WL survey to reach the cosmological objectives, see [RD03].",,1,,,,,,,,
The statistical error (z)/(1+z) in the photo-z’s shall be smaller than 0.05 (require- ment) and 0.03 (goal) in the range 0.2<z<2.0 with a low level catastrophic failures.,,0,,,,,,,,
Photometric redshifts will be used to group the galaxies in redshift bins with small overlaps.,,0,,,,,,,,
The catastrophic failure fraction (fcat) is defined as the fraction of galaxies whose photo-z lies beyond 3 (TBC) of the true redshift.,,0,,,,,,,,
The mean of the redshift distribution n(z) of each bin must be known to a precision of δ(‹zi›)/(1+z) <0.002.,,0,,,,,,,,
Higher moments of the distribution must also be known but are less constraining.,,0,,,,,,,,
"This can be achieved with a spectroscopic subsample of about 105 galaxies representative of the WL sample [RD01, RD02].",,1,,,,,,,,
"The results of simulations show that a competitive value of the FoM (DETF [RD08]) for the slitless spectroscopic survey is obtained for an H limiting flux of 4×10-16 erg cm-2 s-1, 7σ at 1.6 micron and unresolved source.",,0,,,,,,,,
This flux limit corresponds to a total estimated number of 7×107 redshifts.,,0,,,,,,,,
The accuracy in the spectroscopic redshift of each detected galaxy shall be better than be z ≤ 0.001(1+z).,,0,,,,,,,,
This requirement is based on extensive simulations of the statistical reconstruction of large-scale structure and the successive measurement of the BAO fluctuations in the power spectrum analysis.,,0,,,,,,,,
"In case of larger values of z, the BAO FoM will decrease significantly.",,1,,,,,,,,
Experience with ground- based spectroscopy at resolution R=600 shows that it is possible to reach an uncertainty in the redshift determination of σz ≈ 3×10-4(1+z).,,0,,,,,,,,
"At R = 500, which is our baseline case, the accuracy should scale down to σz ≈ 5×10-4(1+z).",,0,,,,,,,,
Requirement: the survey area shall be at least 20 000 deg2.,,0,,,,,,,,
This minimum area for the wide survey is set by the cosmic variance.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The number of galaxy spectra (and hence redshifts) required to meet the accuracy needed in the BAO measurement for the wide-field survey shall be 4×107 as minimum, and 1.5×108 as a target.",,0,,,,,,,,
These values are set by the BAO statistics we have to achieve.,,0,,,,,,,,
Caveat: the assumption (number of detectable spectra) = (number of redshift) does not hold as there will always be some “redshift success rate” which will make Nredshift < Nspectra.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The median redshift of the wide survey shall be at z~1.1, with an upper quartile at z~1.35.",,0,,,,,,,,
Requirement: A spectroscopic subsample of at least 105 spectra representative of the galaxies used for WL shall be obtained to calibrate the photometric redshifts.,,0,,,,,,,,
The Euclid spectroscopic channel is considered not sensitive enough to fulfil the photo-z calibration requirement if one assumes a deep survey which is 2 mag deeper than the wide survey.,,1,,,,,,,,

"The wide survey not only provides a large amount of additional science information, but it is also necessary for calibration purposes.",,0,,,,,,,,
The survey depth will be achieved by repeating about 40 times the observations of the same fields using the same wide survey observing modes.,,1,,,,,,,,
"By carefully choosing the time intervals between the repeats, the deep survey data will be used to monitor the stability of the payload and spacecraft.",,0,,,,,,,,
"In addition, a large number of spectra can be used for the calibration of the weak lensing photometric redshift determination.",,0,,,,,,,,
In this section we describe the science that can be carried out with Euclid in addition to the Cosmology objectives as given in Section 3.1.,,0,,,,,,,,
The wide and deep surveys will provide a unique legacy which can address many areas of astronomy.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The importance of the mission legacy depends on (1) the size and depth, (2) the spatial resolution, (3) the spectral resolution, and (4) wavelength coverage of the survey.",,1,,,,,,,,
The requirements on (1) to (4) follow directly from the WL and BAO spectroscopic redshift survey requirements.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Besides its Dark-Energy-specific science goals, the combination by Euclid of imaging and spectro- scopy over 20,000 contiguous square degrees at high galactic latitude will result in an immense legacy value for the astronomy community, impacting a wide range of science topics.",,1,,,,,,,,
"With its high angular resolution imaging (~0.16 arcsec in the optical channel), morphologies will be measured for billions of galaxies out to z~2, together with their optical-infrared colours.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The unprecedented Euclid spectroscopic survey will produce at the same time the ultimate three-dimensional map of the distribution of luminous matter, along with the spectral properties of 200 million galaxies, over three-quarters of the lifetime of the Universe.",,0,,,,,,,,
Euclid will therefore trace directly with exquisite statistics the evolution of galaxies within the dark/luminous scaffolding of the Universe measured respectively by weak lensing and galaxy redshifts.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Euclid will sample between z= 0.5 and z= 2 a volume of 100 h-3 Gpc3, i.e. 1000 times that of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Obtain a complete census of galaxies over two-thirds of the age of the Universe and measure the evolution of their distribution functions (e.g. luminosity, stellar mass), reconstructing the history of star formation, mass assembly and nuclear activity.",,0,,,,,,,,
Of utmost importance is the impact that Euclid will have on future surveys at any wavelength.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The Euclid spectro-photometric database will in fact allow straightforward and precise optical iden- tification (thanks to the sub-arcsecond imaging) and distance measurement of millions of objects that will be discovered by forthcoming or planned new survey facilities, like Herschel, Planck, LOFAR, eROSITA, WISE, SKA and SPT.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Sunyaev-Zeldovich surveys with SPT (4000 deg2) and Planck (all-sky) will yield several thousand cluster detections (>10,000 expected with SPT, ~8000 with Planck).",,0,,,,,,,,
"The majority of these will be visible and measurable by Euclid, which will provide a unique mean to obtain redshifts and calibrate their mass.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Similarly, 50,000 groups/clusters will be readily identified in the eROSITA X-ray survey by simply cross-correlating with the Euclid data- base.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Of these, there will be 20,000 clusters at z>0.5 with mass >1014 solar, whose mass will be calibrated using the weak lensing shear and correlated to X-ray and optical observables.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Cross-correlation of Planck data with the Euclid galaxy redshift and weak lensing data will be uniquely useful for removing the dominant systematic effect, CMB lensing, in the primordial gravity wave signal from Planck.",,0,,,,,,,,
CMB lensing is the gravitational lensing of the CMB signal by the intervening galaxies.,,0,,,,,,,,
"This will help increase the likelihood that the “smoking-gun” signature of in- flation, primordial gravity waves, will be discovered at high significance in the Planck data.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The analysis of the shape, turnover and slope of the galaxy power spectrum P(k) would be of immense value to the estimation of the cosmological parameters, as a probe of primordial fluctuations, to tests of inflationary models, and to matter density and baryonic and neutrino fractions studies.",,0,,,,,,,,
The legacy will also provide a database for quasars with z>7 and for the study of the cosmic NIR background.,,0,,,,,,,,
"These are only the most obvious examples of the immense legacy impact of Euclid, that will be a crucial support for any future multi-wavelength survey and a gold mine for new discoveries for decades, removing the classical “bottle neck” represented by the follow-up identification and redshift measurement.",,0,,,,,,,,
The possibility that Euclid performs a deeper imaging/spectroscopic survey over a few tens of square degrees opens a further broad window of opportunity.,,0,,,,,,,,
"With, e.g., infrared imaging to H=25 and spectroscopy to H=24 will sample galaxies with 2<z<5.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Objects at z>5 and up to z~10 can be colour-selected from the Y, J, H photometry.",,1,,,,,,,,
The most massive galaxies at these redshifts will be extremely rare.,,0,,,,,,,,
"The large FOV of the Euclid spectroscopic mode, compared to JWST, gives it an enormous advantage: only ~0.3 massive galaxies should be present in the JWST field of view of ~10 arcmin2.",,0,,,,,,,,
EUCLID is the natural complement to JWST for the study of high-redshift galaxies.,,0,,,,,,,,
A significant fraction of these galaxies are expected to have Ly-α emission.,,0,,,,,,,,
At z~6 the fraction of Ly- α emitters in a Lyman-dropout sample is as high as ~30%.,,0,,,,,,,,
"With the Euclid payload capabilities, small changes in the survey mode of observations could address different important astronomy topics.",,0,,,,,,,,
Below we list possible areas of astronomy which may be addressed.,,0,,,,,,,,
Opportunities may arise during periods when the wide and deep surveys cannot be carried out in the nominal way.,,1,,,,,,,,
"For example, during the equinoxes, the galactic polar caps (b>30 degrees) are poorly visible, and these periods can be dedicated to Milky Way science.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Due to the longer expected lifetime of the NIR detectors, search for extra solar planets can be performed using only the NIR detectors during the later stages of the mission.",,1,,,,,,,,
The feasibility of additional science objectives depends on the implementation of the science requirements of the primary science objectives.,,1,,,,,,,,
"We provide a list of science topics, which can be investigated with Euclid, and would provide a major scientific contribution to that topic.",,0,,,,,,,,
Requirements on dedicated observing modes and survey strategies to optimize additional science observations need detailed investigation.,,0,,,,,,,,
A spectroscopic and photometric survey of the galactic plane.,,0,,,,,,,,
The Euclid payload and mission concept design must fit in the ESA Cosmic Visions M-class envelope.,,0,,,,,,,,
Review of the assessment phase studies has lead to the recommendation that the mission is programmatically feasible only if mass of the payload has a sufficient margin of 30% for a Soyuz ST-2.1B launch from Kourou.,,1,,,,,,,,
"In addition, considering that the procurement of the long-lead items for Euclid is critically driving the schedule, it was recommended to constrain the amount of detectors in Euclid to a number significantly lower than envisaged in the Euclid Assessment Study Report [RD10].",,0,,,,,,,,
"These recommendations required serious revisit of the mission and payload concept design, which has been worked out during the optimization period during the first part of the definition phase.",,0,,,,,,,,
Weak lensing measurements place specific constraints on image quality as it relates to the analysis of the shapes of galaxies to determine cosmic shear.,,0,,,,,,,,
"In particular, we need to deconvolve the galaxy shapes from the Point Spread Function (PSF).",,,0,,,,,,,
This process involves measuring the PSF from the field stars and using this to correct the shapes of the galaxies in the field.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Requirement: A broad red band R+I+Z (550nm – 920nm) shall be used, chosen to be optimal for galaxy shape measurements.",,,0,,,,,,,
The usage of more than 1 filter band can be considered.,,,0,,,,,,,
Galaxy shapes for gravitational lensing is best measured in the red part of the visible spectrum.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The FWHM size of the system PSF at the reference wavelength of 800 nm shall be between 0.18 and 0.23 arcsec, not including pixelisation.",,,0,,,,,,,
The size is defined as the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of the PSF averaged azimuthally about the PSF centroid.,,,0,,,,,,,
This requirement together with requirement 4.2.1.3 enables to obtain the number density of resolved galaxies (i.e. with a size greater than the PSF) usable for the weak lensing analysis.,,,1,,,,,,,
The system PSF at 800nm shall be sampled with (CCD) detector pixels subtending less or equal to 0.1 arcsec.,,,0,,,,,,,
This requirement is coupled to requirement 4.2.1.2.,,,0,,,,,,,
Together they provide the nominal sampling for the shear measurement of resolved galaxies at the sensitivity limit.,,,0,,,,,,,
"To achieve sub-pixel sampling, the array of detector pixels has to be moved with steps in two per- pendicular directions that are not integers of the pixel pitch.",,,0,,,,,,,
A commonly used technique to achieve this is dithering of the detector array.,,,0,,,,,,,
"This requirement assumes 4 dithers (see below) to allow PSF calibration using stars in the field, and galaxy shape measurements after PSF deconvolution.",,,0,,,,,,,
More than 96% of the central flux (83% of the total flux) should be contained in a diameter of less than 3.0 times the FWHM.,,,0,,,,,,,
The system PSF also shall have a small number of degrees of freedom for its dynamic variation.,,,0,,,,,,,
"By dynamic we mean the part that cannot be calibrated from an image taken at a different time, such as a calibration run.",,,0,,,,,,,
Control of systematics is of crucial importance for the Euclid mission.,,,0,,,,,,,
It is assumed that there are sufficient calibration stars in the field to calibrate the shape of the system PSF.,,,0,,,,,,,
The ellipticity and FWHM of the dynamic part of the PSF shall have small spatial variations over typically 50 arcmin2 and timescales of ~3 days.,,,0,,,,,,,
The standard deviation of the variations shall be less than 2x10-4 absolute and the FWHM stability shall be 0.1%.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The ellipticity of the PSF is defined as (FWHM(x)2-FWHM(y)2)/(FWHM(x)2+FWHM(y)2), where x and y refer to the major and minor axis of the PSF FWHM contour.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The dynamic part of the PSF cannot be calibrated from an image taken at a different time, such as a calibration run.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The three days is derived from an initially required stability of 3 wide survey adjacent strips, which is per- formed in approximately 2-3 days.",,,0,,,,,,,
The 50 arcmin2 comes from the fact that ~50 bright stars (brighter than a magnitude R=18) are necessary to calibrate the PSF by measuring it from these stars.,,,0,,,,,,,
Stars of this type typically have a number density of 1 per arcmin2 (RD06).,,,0,,,,,,,
Requirement: Over the wavelength range 550–920 nm (Req.,,,0,,,,,,,
The linearity of the detector response shall be calibratable to a precision of TBD for a S/N dynamic range of 1 to 1000.,,,0,,,,,,,
PSF calibration process involves measuring PSF from high S/N stars (R~18 mag) and using this to deconvolve the instrument response from low S/N galaxies.,,,0,,,,,,,
The flux per pixel due to diffuse straylight (including sky contamination within and out of the field of view) shall be less than 20% of the flux of the zodiacal light at the ecliptic poles.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The combined effect of glitches (including cosmic rays) and dead pixels shall be removable to less than a few percent (5%, TBD) of pixels in the images.",,,0,,,,,,,
Requirements on dead pixel clustering properties are TBD.,,,0,,,,,,,
"A common technique to reduce the impact of glitches and dead pixels is to use dithering (see below, Req.",,,0,,,,,,,
Requirement: geometrical distortions on scales of 1 arcsec (i) shall be lower than 1% anywhere in the FOV and (ii) shall be calibrated with residuals at a level of less than 0.1 percent.,,,0,,,,,,,
This is to control the shapes of the lensed galaxies with respect to possible instrument systematics.,,,0,,,,,,,
Accurate measurement of the photometric redshift of distant galaxies (0<z<3) requires space based photometry in the NIR.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The NIR photometry shall be carried out at least 3 wavelength bands, in particular Y (920-1146nm), J(1146-1372nm), and Hp(1372-1600nm) (Hp(1372-2000nm, goal).",,,0,,,,,,,
"These bands (designated Y, J, and Hp) provide the ideal synergy with ground based surveys complement to meet the photometric redshift requirements.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Requirement: To achieve the needed photometry, the resolution in the centre of the J band (1259 nm) shall be between 0.3 and 0.36 arcsec (system PSF FWHM) with a plate scale less or equal to A sampling of ~1 pixel per system PSF FWHM or slightly higher would give the best photometric results for point sources and is related to intra-pixel response, as most of the energy would fall within 1 detector pixel with a minimum background emission contribution.",,,0,,,,,,,
Requirement: the “final” relative photometric accuracy (i.e. at the end of the data processing) shall be less or equal to 0.5% for the photometry supporting the photometric redshifts.,,,0,,,,,,,
This number applies to the uniformity within a field and among areas on the sky.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The final cali- bration includes the off-line data processing of the fields, which assumes additional ground-based information (secondary standard stars) and the possibility of “self calibration” based on consisten- cies in the (redundant) Euclid data.",,,0,,,,,,,
"As long as the relative accuracy is met, the absolute photometric accuracy can be constructed from the data afterwards.",,,1,,,,,,,
Enough statistics will be available from standard stars to obtain a consistent absolute photometric calibration of TBD final accuracy.,,,0,,,,,,,
The flux per pixel of diffuse straylight (including sky contamination within and out of the field of view) shall be less than 20% of the flux of the zodiacal light at the ecliptic poles.,,,0,,,,,,,
Requirement: Slitless or other multi-object spectroscopy shall be used for the spectroscopic redshift survey.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The parameters to be considered are: number of grisms needed to cover appropriately the total observed spectral range (≈ 1.0 – 2.0 μm, see req.",,,0,,,,,,,
A TBD fraction of the spectroscopic redshifts coming from the slitless or other multi-object spectroscopy can be used to calibrate the photo-z redshifts (see Sect 4.5.2).,,,0,,,,,,,
"Requirement: the flux limit for an unresolved emission line shall be less than 4×10-16 erg cm-2 s-1 (7 sigma, point source) at 1600 nm, and the continuum magnitude limit is H(AB) = 19.5 mag.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Requirement: the spectral range shall be 1.0-2.0 micron (required, <1.0 to >2.0 micron goal) to ensure the detection of spectral features expected for the redshift distributions of the galaxy samples.",,,1,,,,,,,
"The spectral resolution for a point source shall be R = λ/dλ = 500 constant to ±20, where dλ = resolution element = 2 detector pixels.",,,0,,,,,,,
Requirement: the success rate shall be larger than 35% (fraction) at the Hα flux limit according to req.,,,0,,,,,,,
With the success rate or detection efficiency we mean the number of redshifts that can be retrieved from the available targets above the given detection limit.,,,0,,,,,,,
Requirement: A NIR image of the same field as covered by the slitless spectrograph shall be acquired with a depth which is sufficiently deep to always allow an association between an emission line (without continuum) detected in the dispersed image with a counterpart in the field image.,,,1,,,,,,,
"The NIR image is necessary for providing the positions of the objects, to derive accurately the zero- point of the wavelength scale (crucial for BAOs), to remove ambiguities with zero order spectra contamination, to derive the object sizes and orientations in order to enable the correct definition of the extraction aperture of the spectra as well as the flagging of contamination of spectra.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The Euclid photometry channel H-band exposure would provide a depth of H(AB) < 24 mag, which satisfies this requirement.",,,0,,,,,,,
Requirement: the maximum error in the wavelength of a given spectral resolution element shall be less than 50% (TBC) fraction of that spectral element.,,,0,,,,,,,
This requirement addresses both the wavelength zero point calibration as well as the accuracy in the wavelength scale of a spectrum.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In the case of for example R=500 and a fraction of 0.5, we obtain for the wavelength error contribution Δz ≤0.5/500=0.001, in accordance with Req.",,,0,,,,,,,
The wavelength zero point is driven by the accuracy which can be achieved in the mapping of the sources in the field image (req.,,,0,,,,,,,
"This mapping is governed by two essential sources of uncertainty: (1) the distortions (including displacements) due to the optical elements in the instruments providing the field image and the dispersed image, and (2) temporal distortions due to varying observing conditions, e.g. due to temperature variations.",,,0,,,,,,,
"On ground and also with HST it is common practice to periodically acquire a direct image in a given filter (J or H band, TBC) with the spectrometer to calibrate out the time dependent distortions.",,,0,,,,,,,
The measurement frequency depends on the timescale of the time dependent field distortions.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In this case there must be the facility to use a filter and take a direct image of some astrometric field to establish the transformation from the RA, Dec catalogue (from NIP) to the slitless instrument from in-orbit data.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In practice, and for integrity of the wavelength information, a short direct image through the slitless instrument taken periodically with a filter is enough to align the pointing to the RA, Dec catalogue together with the time independent field distortions.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The direct image can be with a filter (J or H band being the obvious choice) or could be filter-less, thus exactly matching the slitless spectroscopy passband.",,,1,,,,,,,
"This approach requires accurate repeatability of the filter wheel holding the grism, since any non-repeatability must be at the level of small fractions of a pixel in order not to compromise the wavelength accuracy (a crucial requirement for the BAO experiment).",,,1,,,,,,,
In high latitude fields the number of late type stars may not be sufficient to perform adjustment of the wavelength zero point.,,,0,,,,,,,
The size of the PSF at 80% encircled energy shall be less than 1 arcsec (TBC) in imaging mode and better than 1 pixel in cross dispersion (spectroscopic mode).,,,0,,,,,,,
"Requirement: A number of spectrally dispersed images shall be acquired over each elementary field of view, the integration time being driven by the spacecraft dither strategy.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Requirement: For each elementary field 4 (TBC) rotation angles will be selected, or 4 (TBC) sub- samples of the spectral apertures will be filtered.",,,0,,,,,,,
The flux per pixel of diffuse straylight shall be less than 20% of the flux of the zo- diacal light at the ecliptic poles.,,,0,,,,,,,
The diffuse straylight includes sky contamination within and out of the field of view.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Requirement: To achieve the statistics described above, a wide survey shall be performed over a large fraction of the extragalactic sky (larger or equal to 20,000 deg2).",,,0,,,,,,,
The extragalactic sky covers high galactic latitudes (b>30deg) while avoiding the galactic bulge.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The survey depth in terms of AB magnitude limit shall be R+I+ZAB =24.5 (10σ extended source), assuming a PSF FWHM of 0.23 arcsec in this band.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Requirement: To meet the photometric redshift requirement, the depth in each of the Y, J and H NIR bands shall be 24 AB (5σ point source).",,,1,,,,,,,
This depth yields the required 30 galaxies/arcmin2 useful for lensing with a median redshift zm >0.8.,,,0,,,,,,,
The wide survey needs to be performed in patches contiguous in time and larger than 20×20 deg2 to ensure homogeneous image quality on scales relevant for weak lensing.,,,0,,,,,,,
"According to the adopted Euclid survey strategy, a patch (of ~20×20 deg2) is made of contiguous strips of 20 degrees.",,,0,,,,,,,
Requirement: the total overlap between adjacent images shall be 2.5% on each side.,,,0,,,,,,,
This is needed to derive astrometric and photometric solutions as well as shape measurement cross– checks.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Requirement: at least 4 dithers shall be performed with the VIS imaging channel to cover the detector gaps such that 95% of the pixels of the coadded image has at least 3 exposures, and more than 60% of the pixels have 4 exposures.",,,1,,,,,,,
The signal-to-noise ratio specification shall be met after 3 exposures.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Requirement: at least 4 dithers shall be performed for each band of the NIP channel for gap filling between the detectors and sub-pixel information, such that 95% of the pixels of the coadded image has at least 3 exposures, and more than 60% of the pixels has 4 exposures.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Dithering is needed in the visible and NIR ima- ging channels to fill the gaps between the detector arrays, to mitigate the effect of clusters of bad pixels, to improve the PSF calibration and galaxy shape measurement from sub-pixel information, to provide for a distortion map, and to allow for cross-correlations between exposures.",,,1,,,,,,,
The requirement is based on a typical cosmic ray rate.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The objectives of the Deep Survey are: (1) to provide the Euclid additional science, in particular to investigate galaxy formation with very high statistical confidence (see Section 3.2.2), (2) to obtain spectroscopic redshifts required to calibrate the photometric redshifts needed for the weak lensing experiment, and (3) to support the calibration of the visible PSF by repeatedly visiting the same fields on the sky.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In view of the importance of the wide survey in relation to the Euclid science objectives, the im- plementation of the deep survey must not impair the quality and completeness of the wide survey.",,,0,,,,,,,
"For the NIS slitless spectra, the wide survey limiting magnitude H(AB)=19.5 mag is more than 2 magnitudes higher (i.e. brighter) than the NIP limiting magnitude of H(AB)=24 mag.",,,0,,,,,,,
"If we adopt the deep survey strategy as outlined below, the NIS data are not sufficiently deep to obtain a spectroscopic subsample of ~105 spectra for the NIP photo-z calibration down to AB=24 mag (cf Reqs.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Nevertheless, such a deep survey from space with a slitless spectrometer provides a unique opportunity to obtain an unprecedented data set, both for scientific as well as for cross-calibration purposes.",,,0,,,,,,,
The slitless deep survey data can be used to calibrate the WL target selection function.,,,0,,,,,,,
The deep survey is based on the requirements listed in the following sections and the requirement given in Section.,,,0,,,,,,,
The effect of the different FoVs for the VIS/NIP on the one hand and the NIS on the other hand has to be assessed (TBD).,,,0,,,,,,,
Requirement: A deep imaging survey shall be built from multiple visits similar to the wide survey scans.,,,0,,,,,,,
The method of selecting the targets for slit spectroscopy down to H(AB)=24 mag is under discussion.,,,0,,,,,,,
"We are presently considering the options (1) to use the imaging mode of the spectroscopic channel and increase the limiting magnitude to 24 mag, or (2) use the NIR photometric channel to perform a (pre-)selection of the spectroscopic targets.",,,0,,,,,,,
Method (2) considers the construction of a catalogue using the NIS/VIS data containing all spectroscopic candidates in a given field down to H(AB)=24 mag.,,,0,,,,,,,
The NIS imaging exposure will be used to determine the position an orientation of the array on the sky.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Using the catalogue, the DMD will be set after a selection of a TBD fraction of the candidates with H(AB) < 24 mag.",,,0,,,,,,,
The target selection can be random but can also be based on scientific considerations – e.g. high (photo- )z galaxies.,,,0,,,,,,,
"One could think of the following survey strategy: if the catalogue selection is a random fraction of for example 33%, then 120 exposures of a given field would give an average total integration time of 6.3x6.3=40 exposures for all galaxy candidates in the field (2 mag = factor 6.3).",,,1,,,,,,,
"The numbers can be tuned depending on the construction of the selection catalogue (TBC), such that the required minimum deep survey area is met.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In case of slitless spectroscopy, there is no selection of the targets.",,,1,,,,,,,
The slitless spectroscopy for the deep survey will be as deep as H(AB)<21.5 mag or 0.5-0.8×10-16 erg cm-2 s-1.,,,0,,,,,,,
Requirement: Visits of the same field shall be evenly distributed over the lifetime of the mission.,,,0,,,,,,,
This requirement ensures the monitoring of the PSF at regular intervals during the mission.,,,0,,,,,,,
The imaging depth of the deep survey shall be 2 mag deeper than that of the wide survey with R+I+Z < 24.5 mag.,,,0,,,,,,,
This requirement implies about 40 visits of the same deep field area.,,,0,,,,,,,
The spectroscopic channel enables a Deep Survey over a field of a few square degrees (e.g. ≈ 40 deg2).,,,0,,,,,,,
"In the Deep Field survey, most of the spectroscopic sample will be a flux-limited selection down to a limiting magnitude of R+Y+Z=24.0 with no colour or photo-z cuts.",,,0,,,,,,,
A fraction of objects (e.g. very high-z galaxy candidates) may be observed as compulsory targets in each visit.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The cumulative sky surface density to H =24.0 is ≈ 125,000 galaxies deg-2.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Given a sky coverage of 40 deg2, we expect to obtain spectra and derive spectroscopic redshifts for about 4 105 galaxies at 0 < z < 6 even with a low sampling rate of 10%.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Requirement: A spectroscopic deep survey shall be performed with a total area of at least 40 deg2, complete for galaxies with R+I+Z < 24.5 mag, and consisting of patches with a minimum size of 10 deg2.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Requirement: the deep-field spectroscopic survey shall have at least 105 galaxies with a limiting magnitude H(AB) = 24.0 mag in order to match the depth of the near-IR photometric channel and R+I+Z=24 mag (AB) corresponds to about H(AB)=24, depending of the colours of the targets (TBD).",,,1,,,,,,,
The deep survey is 2 mag = factor 6.3 deeper than the wide survey.,,,0,,,,,,,
The implied total integration time (without overheads) for the spectrum of a deep field target is equivalent to ~40 wide survey exposures.,,,0,,,,,,,
The equivalent S/N requirements are the same as for the wide survey where H(AB)=22 mag (see req.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Simulations showed that at this limiting magnitude, the success rate in redshift measurements is high for all types of galaxies (see the PDD for more information).",,,0,,,,,,,
"Requirement: deep survey patches shall be acquired in successive order, i.e. the measurements of a patch have to be completed as good as possible before moving to the next patch.",,,0,,,,,,,
"As a goal, the frequency of the visits of a given patch shall be twice a month (once every 14-16 days).",,,0,,,,,,,
With “coverage” we mean the area surveyed in wide survey mode.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Assuming that the wide and deep surveys are intertwined, a duty cycle of 32-36 fields per day, and that the completion of a wide survey patch (of 400 deg2 plus 10% overlap) can be accomplished within one month, the amount of time available for the deep survey is equivalent to~2-5 days per month.",,,0,,,,,,,
In this period it is possible to carry out 3-8 visits where an entire patch of 10 deg2 is covered.,,,1,,,,,,,
The margins for the Euclid mission are tight: the wide survey scanning strategy needs to be well op- timized even with a nominal mission time of 5 years.,,,0,,,,,,,
From an operational point of view it is impor- tant to assess the required completeness of the survey due to the tight viewing constraints and due to the fact that it is not possible to trade survey depth for survey area once the field observing mode has been fixed.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In the following, the completeness requirements are provided at the different scales in area dictated by the wide survey characteristics.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Requirement: To meet the science objectives, the total wide survey area to be collected shall be more than 95% of the required area of 20,000 deg2.",,,1,,,,,,,
The wide survey shall be contained in two contiguous areas at the two hemispheres with no holes due to missed patches.,,,0,,,,,,,
This requirement addresses possible situations where e.g. due to system events the survey cannot be completed in the nominal survey period.,,,0,,,,,,,
"For Euclid, the area surveyed scales directly with the dark energy Figure of Merit, hence the choice of the 95% level.",,,0,,,,,,,
"We must cover the two hemispheres without holes, i.e. the “missed” patches should be along the edges of the areas.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Requirement: In case a nominal patch of 400 deg2 cannot be completed in the allocated amount of observing time at a given epoch, the “lost” fields shall be situated at the edge of the patch.",,,1,,,,,,,
"This means that “holes” should be avoided inside a patch due to “missed” fields, and rescheduling is necessary to trade the hole for a “lost” field at the edge of patch.",,,1,,,,,,,
"A field can be declared missed if no pointing was performed, (2) the science quality of a pointing was insufficient, or (3) the observing procedure went wrong, as was indicated in the S/C or instrument House Keeping.",,,0,,,,,,,
A minimum number of missed fields (TBC) will define a “missed” patch.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Requirement: For a given field, the presence of one non-responsive detector array for each of the VIS or NIP instruments can be tolerated during the field observing sequence.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In case of a larger number of non-responsive detector arrays for VIS or NIP, and in case of one or more non- responsive detector arrays for NIS, the planned survey scanning strategy or the field observing sequence shall be modified.",,,1,,,,,,,
One non-responsive detector array for NIS (of 2Kx2K pixels) implies a loss of 1/8 of the survey area in the present configuration.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Requirement: in case of the presence of clusters of bad pixels invalidating the dithering require- ment 4.5.1.5, the planned scanning strategy or the field observing sequence shall be modified.",,,1,,,,,,,
"For spectroscopy target selection photometric accuracy, see Req.",,,0,,,,,,,
The following table gives a summary of the envisaged dedicated in-orbit calibration operations to be performed on a regular basis throughout the mission.,,,0,,,,,,,
The table has been derived from the discussions during the CDF pre-assessment, its contents have to be confirmed.,,,0,,,,,,

"Within the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI), a global monitoring program driven by GCOS requirements is in development to provide long-term satellite-based products which can serve the climate modeling and climate user community.",,,0,,,,,,,
Land Cover has been selected as one of 11 ECVs which will be elaborated during the first phase of CCI (2010-2013).,,,0,,,,,,,
"In the first stage of the Land Cover CCI project, a user requirements analysis has been conducted to derive the specifications for a new global land cover product to address the needs of key-users from the climate modeling community.",,,0,,,,,,,

"As part of the requirements analysis, an user consultation mechanism was set-up to actively involve different climate modeling groups by setting out surveys to different type of users: 1) a group of key- users, most of them also participating in CMUG, 2) associated climate users who are involved and leading the development of key climate relevant models and application, and 3) the broad land cover data user community reflected in the scientific literature and represented by users of the ESA GlobCover product.",,,0,,,,,,,
"As proxy for (tracking) human activities, i.e. land use affecting land cover; As datasets for validation of model outcomes (i.e. time series) or to study feedback effects.",,,0,,,,,,,

"Next to the surveys, requirements from the GCOS Implementation Plan 2004 and 2010 and associated strategic earth observation documents for land cover (GTOS, IGOL, IGCO and CMUG) were considered and integrated.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Finally, a detailed literature review was carried out with special attention to innovative concepts and approaches to better reflect land dynamics in the next generation climate models.",,,0,,,,,,,

This document describes the activities and results for the user requirement analysis (WP1100) for the product specification as part of the Land Cover CCI project within ESA’s Climate Change Initiative Program.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The overall objective for the Land Cover CCI project is to critically revisit all algorithms required for the generation of a global land product in the light of the GCOS requirements, and to design and demonstrate a prototype system delivering in a consistent way over years and from various EO instruments global land cover information matching the needs of key users belonging to the climate change community.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In the first stage of the project, the detailed specifications of a global land cover product will be defined which matches the requirements from GCOS (both for itself and as a surrogate for other important climate variables) and key climate users, and which is achievable on a regular basis using the current EO systems and building on the UN Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) for consistency and interoperability with other land cover products.",,,0,,,,,,,
"To do so, key climate and carbon modeling users will be consulted to ensure the developed Land Cover products meet the requirements for a range of model communities and for application of existing and future modeling approaches (WP1100).",,,1,,,,,,,

"In section 3.3, the assessment of the climate modeling community requirements is presented both for the key and associated user group and finalizing with the review on (future) requirements from climate modeling literature.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Issues of global, regional and national forest and land cover observations have recently received significant attention in a number of international processes on the political level, offering opportunities to improving relevance, acceptance, and approaches to operationalize global and regional land cover assessments.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Since technological progress and methodological sophistication alone is not sufficient to implement global land assessments effectively, particular emphasize on fostering more saliency and legitimacy of land cover observations is needed in addition to technical credibility.",,,1,,,,,,,
"The efforts of Land Cover CCI projects also address the issue to build a bridge between policy requirements, and scientific progress and consensus.",,,0,,,,,,,
"It involves engagement with prominent political processes, the gathering of observation requirements, providing technical policy advice, the definition of observation strategies and priorities, evolving international technical consensus on critical issues, the specification of implementation guidelines, and implementation of dedicated case studies fostering technical progress, operations and applications.",,,0,,,,,,,
"These activities are progressing in four major thematic areas: (a) standards for land cover characterization, (b) standard methods for land cover accuracy assessment, (c) global land cover observations and applications and (d) land cover change monitoring.",,,0,,,,,,,
"As a prominent example, the current evolving activities to support the UNFCCC efforts for research and systematic observations of Essential Climate Variables (ECV’s) is taken shape into specific implementation activities such as attempted in Land Cover CCI project.",,,0,,,,,,,
"While there is no detailed guidance on what it means to observe land cover as ECV, there is guidance provided from the political level and its subsidiary technical bodies.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The UNFCCC requiring global land cover observation progress relates to research and systematic observations ((GCOS 2004, 2010b)).",,,0,,,,,,,
"The scope is to continuously monitor ECVs to reduce uncertainties in understanding the global climate system, which includes land cover as one such variable.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The related GCOS implementation plan (GCOS tasks defined in 2004 have been redefined in essential climate variable including (1) the establishment of international standards, (2) consensus methods for map accuracy assessment, (3) the continuity for fine-scale satellite observations, (4) the development of an in situ reference network and the implementation of an operational validation framework, (5) the generation of annual global land-cover products, and (6) the development of a high-resolution global land cover change dataset.",,,0,,,,,,,
"As requested by the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body of Science and Technical Advise (SBSTA), reporting guidelines and standards are being developed for http://www.fao.org/gtos/topcECV.html.",,,0,,,,,,,

"An international coordination mechanism among key actors worldwide (users, producers, science, regional/national experts) is essential to ensure that land cover products are accepted internationally and by the UNFCCC.",,,1,,,,,,,
Such mechanisms are intrinsic to the land cover CCI project and will be described in more detail in chapter 3.,,,0,,,,,,,
Land cover and land cover change are becoming more and more related to the climate modeling effort.,,,0,,,,,,,

"Reliable observations are crucial to monitor and understand the ongoing processes of deforestation, desertification, urbanization, land degradation, loss of biodiversity, ecosystem functions, water and energy management, and the influence of land cover changes on the physical climate system itself.",,,1,,,,,,,
Current IPCC Assessment Reports are based upon an uncertain understanding of the land surface dynamics and related processes.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Applications of land cover and land dynamics in climate change-related General Circulation Models, Earth System Models and Impact Assessment Models need to be better linked and coordinated.",,,0,,,,,,,
The importance of these issues requires continuous monitoring systems and data.,,,1,,,,,,,
"All models are driven by data, whether that data is derived from boundary conditions or through parameter estimation, empirical relationships or direct observations.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In the end, model estimates, and, therefore, model error, reflects the information, or analyses that is used to establish initial conditions, parameter estimation or internal algorithms.",,,0,,,,,,,
"For instance, land-use change emissions are highly uncertain to within a factor of 4, i.e. 500 to 2700 TgC/y (Denman et al.",,,0,,,,,,,
"This restricts our ability to estimate the strength of global carbon sinks; although fossil fuel emissions and atmospheric CO2 concentrations are well-constrained, the large uncertainty in land-use change emissions means that the airborne fraction of total emissions (and hence the fraction of total emissions taken up by land ecosystems and oceans) cannot be constrained so well.",,,0,,,,,,,
"United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is often inconsistent with land-cover data and actual practices (e.g., the extent of global plantation forests is uncertain).",,,0,,,,,,,
"For adequate modeling of processes at the land surface boundary to the atmosphere, an accurate representation of the land surface is necessary.",,,0,,,,,,,
A climate model used to simulate these processes requires a proper determination of the land surface characteristics that are used in its parameterizations as boundary conditions.,,,1,,,,,,,
"These parameters include, e.g., background surface albedo, surface roughness length due to vegetation, fractional vegetation cover and Leaf Area Index (LAI), forest ratio, plant- available soil water holding capacity, and volumetric wilting point.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Three major communities, the General Circulation Models (GCM), Earth System Modeling (ESM), and the Integrated Assessment Modeling (IAM) community play an important role in understanding and quantifying Earth and climate system analysis and specifically, understanding the role of land use and land cover change.",,,0,,,,,,,
These different model communities commonly have a global scope of some kind but focus on different set of objectives (Figure 2).,,,0,,,,,,,
A variety of approaches to addressing land use and land cover change have been considered by these modeling communities.,,,0,,,,,,,
General circulation models (GCMs) include a rather coarse level of ecological and biogeochemical process representation and use land cover as generic and fixed boundary condition.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Earth system model (ESM) modelers have taken an approach that stems from a combination of basic ecosystem (e.g., carbon cycle) and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), and that incorporates different plant functional types (PFTs) into their model structures.",,,0,,,,,,,
"These aspects of ESMs are increasingly being used for impacts assessments, both for ecosystems themselves and the impacts on hydrology which are modified by ecosystem responses.",,,0,,,,,,,
The ESM approach is derived from a tradition of using complex models to analyze the different components and interactions of the physical system.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The focus has mainly been on the climate system, with an initial description of coupled ocean-atmosphere systems, and more recently the carbon cycle and dynamic vegetation.",,,0,,,,,,,
"By extending its focus, the ESM approach is more- and-more implementing coupled climate with hydrology, agriculture and urban systems as integral components of the Earth system.",,,0,,,,,,,
A number of ESM approaches have been developed ranging from GCMs that operate at the 2nd global grid cell scale to soil carbon process models that can be parameterized at the plot scale (Figure 2).,,,0,,,,,,,
DGVMs are the main linking component to extrapolate the highly detailed process representation to the global level by including the state-of-the-art knowledge about the impacts of change on plant-soil interactions and their feedbacks on the climate system.,,,0,,,,,,,
"A broad range of DGVMs of varying degrees of complexity is currently being adopted within ESM: CLM-CN, CLIMBER, JSBACH, IGSM, LPJ, BIOME-BGC, CENTURY, DNDC, HYBRID, SDGVM, TRIFFID, ORCHIDEE (Ostle et al.",,,0,,,,,,,
Most DGVMs utilize the concept of “plant functional types” (PFTs: numbering between 3 and 20) to characterize global (vegetation) land cover diversity.,,,0,,,,,,,
Each PFT represents a broad class of vegetation type such as deciduous forest or grassland and is parameterized for a core set of physiological processes and ecological phenomena.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The IAM approach comes largely from a tradition of modeling human behavior explicitly and the interaction of human activities, decision making and the environment, including economic production and consumption, energy systems, greenhouse gas emissions and land-use.",,,0,,,,,,,
"This community has also recognized the importance of land use as a critical factor in socio-economic decision making, for example for food and timber production, the state of ecosystems and their services, and increasingly, as a response to demand for biofuels for the electricity and transportation sectors.",,,0,,,,,,,
"While many IAMs have focused strongly on energy-economy systems and only included land use emissions as exogenous factors, this is now changing with the development and implementation of increasingly coupled socio- economic and climate modeling strategies.",,,1,,,,,,,
Several actors and types of users will be involved in representing the modeling communities concerned with climate and climate change issues.,,,0,,,,,,,
Broad review of user requirements from the scientific literature including existing uses of land cover data for climate modeling but also on innovative concepts and approaches to better reflect land dynamics in the next generation of models.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Selected users will be invited to participate the product development, implementation and validation and asked to provide input and feedback at different points during the process.",,,0,,,,,,,
Final discussions with the users will yield feedback on the products and results in a set of recommendations to further improve ECV land cover monitoring beyond this project.,,,0,,,,,,,
The purpose of this report is to present the experiences and results of the first step d above and more detailed in Figures 3 and 4.,,,0,,,,,,,
Several actors and types of users can be identified as representatives of the modeling communities concerned with climate and climate change issues.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Potential users that define model requirements originate from groups specialized in different fields of science: e.g., working in weather prediction, Global Circulation Modeling (GCM), Regional Climate Modeling (RCM), Global and Regional Earth System modeling, Carbon Cycle Modeling, Dynamic Vegetation and Hydrology modeling and others.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Potential users of the new land cover products are also model development application groups working in numerical weather prediction (NWP), GCMs and RCMs, global and regional Earth System models, carbon cycle models and dynamic vegetation and hydrology models.",,,0,,,,,,,
"With regard to climate and ESM, this comprises (1) groups participating in the global and regional (CORDEX) IPCC activities for the forthcoming 5th assessment report and (2) groups participating in the EU projects ENSEMBLES (http://ensembles-eu.metoffice.com/) and PRUDENCE http://prudence.dmi.dk/).",,,0,,,,,,,
"With regard to hydrology models, potential users are groups participating in the EU project WATCH (http://www.eu- watch.org/) and the associated WaterMIP (Water Model Intercomparison Project).",,,0,,,,,,,
NWP groups involve national weather services as well as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF).,,,0,,,,,,,
Key users: they are central to all phases of the user interaction within the project and are integral part as partners in the project.,,,0,,,,,,,
"They are the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M), the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l’Environnment (LSCE) and the Meteorological Office Hadley Center (MOHC).",,,0,,,,,,,
"Key users are directly involved in the product specifications, product assessment and the final user assessment of the product.",,,0,,,,,,,
These users maybe participating in meetings and in the user survey and their input would feed into the product specifications.,,,0,,,,,,,
"These users are not partners in the project directly but could be engaged, in particular if involved in the user assessment of the products.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Broad user community: will be considered through information of the project through the World Wide Web and through reviewing scientific literature, participation in meetings to synthesize requirements for the product specifications and through receiving feedback from general global land cover data users.",,,0,,,,,,,
This group of users would also include known user requirements coming not directly from climate modelers but the “climate concerned” users such as those making use of land cover information for other societal benefits or national reporting and accounting.,,,0,,,,,,,
The user consultation will address a broad range of issues due to the nature of the interactions of land cover and climate.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Consequently, land cover user requirements for climate modeling and climate research are expected to be diverse and this complexity is reflected in the user consultation plan as presented in Figure 3 and detailed out in the next sections.",,,0,,,,,,,
The Land Cover CCI project is based on the progress that has been made in terms of land cover characterization and validation procedures and addresses critical tasks which have not achieved sufficient progress up to date.,,,0,,,,,,,
The plan for a thorough and complete user requirements analysis for developing the final product specifications uses a range of sources and mechanisms.,,,0,,,,,,,
There are also different levels of how users representing the climate research community will be involved in this process (Figure 4).,,,0,,,,,,,
"As indicated in the previous section, several actors and types of users are involved in representing the modeling communities concerned with climate and climate change issues.",,,0,,,,,,,
The user consultation dialogue (Figure 4) for Land Cover CCI was coordinated by WUR in close cooperation with the Hadley Center (UK) that is represented in CMUG.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The broad assessment of existing models and user requirements aims at looking, into the range of approaches, how land cover data have been used in climate models.",,,0,,,,,,,
"This assessment includes different modeling approaches and communities, i.e. Global Circulation Models, Earth System Science models, Climate prediction and forecasting models, and integrated Impact Assessment Models.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Detailed literature review of land cover representation in climate modeling, land cover parameterization approaches and studies that looked into the impact of land cover data on climate modeling results.",,,0,,,,,,,
Broad land cover product user survey: user survey on requirements for next generation land cover products with special attention for climate and earth system modeling issues under the user community for the ESA GlobCover product.,,,0,,,,,,,
The set-up and questions for this survey are presented in Appendix A.,,,0,,,,,,,
This broad assessment of user requirements ensures that the full range of needs are considered and understood for deriving the detailed product specifications.,,,1,,,,,,,
The second step in the user consultation process for the product specifications included the partners and processes directly involved or associated with the ESA CCI program and Land Cover CCI project.,,,0,,,,,,,
The aim was to provide a detailed user needs assessment and identify specific requirements coming from the key users of land cover products of the project.,,,0,,,,,,,
"A detailed user survey was conducted on the specific requirements for land cover data characteristics to be used (e.g., spatial, temporal, thematic detail, accuracy requirements).",,,0,,,,,,,
The detailed survey for the key-users (Appendix C was conducted through email while for the associated users a more concise survey was prepared (Appendix B) which was made available to the community (Appendix D) as an online survey.,,,0,,,,,,,
The composition of the two user groups has been described in section 1.4.,,,0,,,,,,,
This part of the user consultation has provided the requirements based on existing model applications requiring land cover data and future needs as identified by this community.,,,0,,,,,,,
These users will also form the primary partners in the user validation and assessment phase to evaluate the Land Cover CCI products in dedicated model applications during next phases of the project.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In the final step, the user consultation targeted at the set of requirements for the next generation models.",,,0,,,,,,,
This is driven by the notion that the CCI products will need to consider not only today’s but future user requirements.,,,0,,,,,,,
New modeling concepts have triggered discussion to improve the existing land cover characterization and parameterization concepts.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Improved observations addressing a range of requirements can play an important role in that process and, therefore, the outcomes presented will also consider user requirements of the next generation modeling approaches.",,,0,,,,,,,
"This has been implemented through an active engagement in scientific dialogs among the climate modeling community, i.e., on harmonization efforts for land cover among the ESM and IAM communities and on improved concepts of land cover parameterization (Hibbart et al., 2010).",,,0,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, the user requirements of the next generation modeling approaches have been distilled from a broad array of (scientific) literature.",,,0,,,,,,,
"And finally, some specific questions in the key and associated user surveys were referring to land cover requirements for future climate modeling concepts.",,,0,,,,,,,
The overall objective of the broad user requirement assessment is to identify how land cover data is currently used by the climate modeling community and what the future requirements for land cover data are for climate and earth system modeling.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In this chapter, first (section 3.1) some core chapters on land cover monitoring from leading strategic earth observation documents are presented.",,,0,,,,,,,
The GCOS requirements on land cover data are provided from the GCOS implementation plan 2004 and from the updated version of 2010.,,,0,,,,,,,
"For completeness, the GCOS needs and principles on land cover data are also presented.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, the GTOS requirements on ECV land cover data standardization frameworks are given, followed by the CMUG, IGOS-P requirements for the Land and Carbon theme and the Integrated Global Carbon Observation (IGCO).",,,0,,,,,,,
In section 3.2 the results of the broad user survey are summarized an visualized.,,,0,,,,,,,
This broad assessment of user requirements ensures that the full range of needs are considered and understood for deriving the detailed product specification.,,,1,,,,,,,
Section 3.3 provides the results of the assessment of the climate modeling community requirements.,,,0,,,,,,,
This includes the results of the key and associate user consultation (3.3.1 and 3.3.3).,,,0,,,,,,,
Section 3.3.2 provides the summary of the comparison of model parameters versus land cover.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, section land cover parameterization approaches and studies that looked into the impact of land cover data on modeling results.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) is a joint undertaking of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Council for Science (ICSU).",,,0,,,,,,,
"In consultation with its partners, GCOS has prepared two implementation plans (GCOS_IP 2004, GCOS_IP 2010) that addresses the requirements identified in the Second Report on the Adequacy of Global Observing Systems for Climate in Support of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).",,,0,,,,,,,
"This Plan, if fully implemented by the Parties both individually and collectively, will provide the global observations of the Essential Climate Variables and their associated products, to assist the parties in meeting their responsibilities (under Articles 4 and 5) of the UNFCCC.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In addition, it will provide many of the essential observations required by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).",,,1,,,,,,,
"As a starting point for the Land Cover CCI project, activities have been closely aligned with specific land cover tasks listed in the GCOS Implementation Plan of 2004 (GCOS 2004) (Table 1).",,,0,,,,,,,
"In this plan, tasks were already listed which were an answer to up till then defined model requirements: the need to harmonize land cover monitoring (GCOS task 22), validation of models (GCOS task 23), model quality assessment (GCOS task 25), and the need for an annual land cover product (GCOS task requirements needed to model the important climate variables for land cover monitoring.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The implementation needs to be building upon progress made to define standards for characterizing land cover and for validation procedures (GCOS Implementation Plan, tasks 22 and 23).",,,0,,,,,,,
"The project further addresses critical tasks that have not achieved sufficient progress to date, i.e., on the implementation of an operational reference network and validation, and to create annual maps of global land cover.",,,0,,,,,,,
These critical tasks are taken up in the GCOS Implementation Plan 2010 (GCOS 2010b).,,,0,,,,,,,
The following paragraphs explain the different GCOS tasks in more detail.,,,0,,,,,,,
There is need for both maps (static and updated) and dynamic monitoring products.,,,0,,,,,,,
The development and derivation of the mapping products need consistency in land cover characterization to be inter- operable as part of an integrated global observing system.,,,0,,,,,,,
The broad areas and topics requiring international consensus are outlined in the GTOS document on standards for observing land cover as ECV with focus on the thematic product ((Herold et al.,,,0,,,,,,,
"This document emphasizes that land cover is defined as the observed (bio)-physical cover on the Earth’s surface, see also the section on the GTOS requirements.",,,0,,,,,,,
"It includes vegetation and man- made features as well as exposed rock, bare soil and inland water surfaces.",,,0,,,,,,,
The primary units for characterizing land cover are categories (such as forest or open water) or continuous variables (http://www.glcn.org/sof_1_en.jsp) provide a comprehensive and flexible framework for thematic land cover characterization.,,,0,,,,,,,
LCCS classifiers enable better compatibility to be achieved between existing datasets and for future global monitoring systems.,,,1,,,,,,,
This issue will be particularly important for the legend development of the ECV Land Cover product.,,,0,,,,,,,
The definition of the target legend is constrained by three issues.,,,0,,,,,,,
"It is dependent on the purpose of application of the land cover map, in this case land cover parameterization for the targeted user communities and their model requirements.",,,1,,,,,,,
Different user groups may have different requirements that will be assessed as part of the project.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Secondly, the LCCS classifier concept is to be used as suggested by GTOS (Herold et al.",,,0,,,,,,,
Thirdly the information for all desired classes must be available and separable from the input observation data sets to derive a product of sufficient quality.,,,0,,,,,,,
"There is also a need to ensure synergy with other ECV observation products (i.e. Fire, Biophysical Parameters, Snow Cover) that are directly related to land cover characteristics.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The thematic validation of the products is required to be on independent nature, follows international standards where existing and uses existing references datasets and related experiences as much as possible.",,,0,,,,,,,
"However, the independent accuracy assessment for monitoring land cover as ECV poses additional requirements and challenges.",,,1,,,,,,,
The validation exercise needs to explore the options to perform validations for multiple dates in time.,,,0,,,,,,,
For historical periods the availability of reference data sets (i.e. for the 1990’s) is rather limited.,,,0,,,,,,,
For the future there is need to develop the foundations and start implementing on operational monitoring that ensures that progressing annual global land cover datasets can assessed consecutively.,,,1,,,,,,,
"For the validation of land cover change, different protocols and approaches will need to be used.",,,0,,,,,,,
"There is need for an independent quality assessment to ensure that the required standards are met, and that uncertainties are quantified and reduced as far as practicable.",,,1,,,,,,,
"While diversity and redundancy is useful for building a sustained global land cover monitoring system and to ensure flexibility in incorporating evolving technologies, there also needs to be an independent assessment mechanism led by the international community.",,,1,,,,,,,
"This mechanism should provide a comparative assessment and validation of individual products and work towards synergy to ensure that a common framework is used for global assessments, and that the “best global estimates” are made available based on the current stage of knowledge, data and information.",,,1,,,,,,,
"The basis for such efforts consists of sustained global network of calibration and validation sites, international agreement and standards and approaches for land cover characterization and validation, and an internal coordination mechanism, currently lead by GOFC-GOLD and the Land Validation sub-group of the CEOS WGCV.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Several global land cover products are currently available at the requested resolution including GLC2000, GlobCover and MODIS land cover products.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Existing global land cover products partially meet the GCOS requirements in terms of performance, as illustrated in Table 2.",,,0,,,,,,,
It indicates that none of the available land cover products meet the requirements expressed by GCOS in terms of class accuracy and stability.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The Land Cover CCI activities are building upon the GlobCover heritage, cooperating with the MODIS team, and aiming at consistent annual global products.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Particular attention will be paid to these two issues, by making the best use of spectral and temporal information content in existing EO time series (through suitable pre-processing and classification processes) and by specifically addressing the issue of inter-annual stability.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Yet, it has to be stated that not all land cover classes have the same importance from a climate modeling perspective.",,,0,,,,,,,
"To this end, the project will also require the definition of a legend.",,,1,,,,,,,
"According to GCOS, a common language for class definition should be used, and thematic detail should be regionally adapted in order to satisfy requirements of international conventions, and as far as possible be harmonized with regional classification schemes presently in use (See the Annex J on Land Cover of the CCI statement of work (EOP-SE 2009b, a).",,,0,,,,,,,
Furthermore it is expected that the product stability over time will be strongly affected by the intrinsic quality of the EO time series available for a given period.,,,0,,,,,,,
"With respect to the potential spatial resolutions required by modelers and with respect to the key associated issues that need to be considered in the ECV development in respect of the model needs, the following GCOS product framework is provided (see Figure 5) (EOP-SE 2009a).",,,0,,,,,,,
"Hereby, the key principle of consistency across spatial scale, time and between ECVs shall be paramount.",,,0,,,,,,,
The land cover product definitions must accordingly concentrate principally on the determination of land cover using MERIS FR and RR and VEGETATION data and in merging these data.,,,0,,,,,,,
A merged VGT and MERIS RR product shall be developed from 2002 onward.,,,0,,,,,,,
"General guidance for the generation of Fundamental Climate Data Records (FCDRs) and derived ECV products based on surface-based, airborne and satellite-based observing systems, and subsequent quality assessment by providers as well as users, is given by the GCOS requirements explained in the previous section as recommended in the GCOS_IP 2004 (GCOS 2004) and its 2010 update GCOS_IP GCOS needs overview GCOS climate observation needs).",,,0,,,,,,,
These requirements are based on a broad consensus by the international climate community, and are reviewed on a regular basis.,,,0,,,,,,
"As part of this, to ensure full documentation, transparency and scientific stewardship in the generation (and update) of FCDRs and ECV products, the GCOS Steering Committee recommends that data producers pay particular attention to the 12 needs enumerated below and provided in the Guideline for the Generation of Datasets and Products Meeting GCOS Requirements (GCOS 2010a).",,,1,,,,,,,
"The Global terrestrial Observing System (GTOS) is a programme for observations, modeling, and analysis of terrestrial ecosystems to support sustainable development.",,,0,,,,,,,
GTOS facilitates access to information on terrestrial ecosystems so that researchers and policy makers can detect and manage global and regional environmental change.,,,0,,,,,,,
GTOS and FAO define land cover as the observed (bio)- physical cover on the Earth’s surface.,,,0,,,,,,,
"It includes vegetation and man-made features as well as exposed rock, bare soil and inland water surfaces.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The primary units for characterizing land cover are categories (such as forest or open water) or continuous variables classifiers (e.g., fraction of tree canopy cover).",,,0,,,,,,,
"Secondary outputs of land cover characterization include surface area of land cover types (hectares), land cover change (area and change trajectories), and observation by-products such as field survey data or processed satellite imagery.",,,0,,,,,,,
"With respect to land cover monitoring, the recent GTOS report (Herold et al.",,,0,,,,,,,
GTOS emphasizes the need for coordinated observations.,,,0,,,,,,,
"An operational global land cover monitoring integrates information from different observation scales, e. integrating coarse and fine scale satellite data and in situ data.",,,0,,,,,,,
"ECV monitoring assumes the use of all useful data sources - from historical archives, present assets and future monitoring programmes in a seamless and consistent manner.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Acquisitions and the derivation of standard products should be coordinated among space agencies (e.g., with support of GEO, CEOS).",,,0,,,,,,,
Integrated and standardized mapping and monitoring refers to the need on static and updated maps and dynamic monitoring products at different spatial and temporal scales.,,,0,,,,,,,
These outputs require different sets of observations and monitoring approaches.,,,1,,,,,,,
The development and derivation of the mapping products need consistency in land cover characterization to be interoperable as part of an integrated global observing system.,,,0,,,,,,,
The broad areas and topics requiring international consensus are outlined in the GTOS document on land cover (Herold et al.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The issue of independent quality assessment follows the need to ensure that the required standards are met, and that uncertainties are quantified and reduced as far as practicable.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Considering the suite of important land cover information (Figure 5), there is expected to be a diversity of products contributing to ECV monitoring.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The basis for such efforts consists of sustained global network of calibration and validation sites, international agreement and standards and approaches for land cover characterization and validation, and an internal coordination mechanism.",,,0,,,,,,,
"One important requirement in the GTOS and FAO related requirement is the fact that land cover information has to be compatible and comparable for multi-temporal analysis and map updates, within and among countries, within and between applications, disciplines and agencies, and across local to global scales (vertical and horizontal harmonization).",,,0,,,,,,,
"The Land Cover Classification System (LCCS, (Di Gregorio 2005)) and the related ontology specified in Land Cover Macro Language (LCML) is currently the most comprehensive, internationally applied and flexible framework for land cover characterization.",,,0,,,,,,,
It defines a system of diagnostic criteria (land cover classifiers) that provides standardization of terminology and not categories.,,,0,,,,,,,
"At this level, existing land cover data can be much better compared.",,,0,,,,,,,
The Land Cover Data Macro Language is undergoing approval to become a standard of the International Standards Organization (ISO).,,,0,,,,,,,
"A translation of existing land cover legends and data into the LCCS language usually provides the first step in developing understanding needed to apply the classifier concept, and many existing global, regional and national land cover legends have been developed or translated using LCCS (see http://www.glcn.org/sof_1_en.jsp).",,,0,,,,,,,
An agreement on a set of recommended classifiers provides the common ground for compatibility of land cover data.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Non-vegetated cover types (bare soil or bare rock, built up areas, snow, ice, open water); Density of life form and leaf characteristics in percent cover; Artificiality of cover and land use.",,,0,,,,,,,
The agreement and application of these classifiers have resulted in a number of generic land cover categories that should be considered in future mapping efforts: Herbaceous vegetation (further separated into grasslands and agricultural crops), Open water.,,,0,,,,,,
"These categories are defined independently of the mapping scale, and any application of a minimum mapping unit will eventually result in mixed unit categories of these generic classes, i.e. through specifying cover percentages for the mapping units.",,,0,,,,,,,
This general approach is suggested for all operational land cover observation activities.,,,0,,,,,,,
International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) is the international research program studying global change across the Earth System.,,,0,,,,,,,
Key projects with reference to land cover include the Analysis Integration and Modeling of the Earth System (AIMES) and the Global Land Project (GLP).,,,0,,,,,,,
Global Observations of Forest and Land Cover Dynamics (GOFC-GOLD) is a project of the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS) program.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The main goal of GOFC/GOLD is to provide a forum for international information exchange, observation and data coordination, and a framework for establishing the necessary long-term monitoring systems (follow this link for documentation of the GOFC-GOLD land cover implementation team).",,,0,,,,,,,
The Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS) is a strategic planning process initiated by a partnership of international organizations that are concerned with the observational component of global environmental change issues.,,,0,,,,,,,
"It links research, long-term monitoring and operational programmes, bringing together the producers of global observations and the users that require them to identify products needed, gaps in observations, and mechanisms to respond to the needs of the science and policy communities.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Its principal objectives are to address how well user requirements are being satisfied by the existing observation systems, and how they could be met more effectively in the future through better integration and optimization of satellite, airborne and in situ observation systems.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Theme was initially proposed in November 2003 on the recognition that IGOS-P had not yet considered many observational needs relating to many aspects of the land, such as sustainable economic development, natural resources management, conservation and biodiversity.",,,0,,,,,,,
To satisfy these needs there is considerable overlap in the types of observations needed by different users and hence assessment of the needs for enhanced observations is discussed under types of observations.,,,0,,,,,,,
Land cover products are recognized by IGOS as having a central role for all applications.,,,0,,,,,,,
Several observation needs and technical requirements are identified in the IGOS report.,,,0,,,,,,,
"A critical requirement is identified to move from research to operational monitoring capabilities for land cover, with operational data and product suites that are better defined, flexible and openly available.",,,0,,,,,,,
Agree upon an internationally accepted land cover classification system, Coordinate international collection of in situ data for calibration and validation efforts.,,,0,,,,,,
The overall goal of the Integrated Global Carbon Observation (IGCO) theme is similar to the overall goal of the ECV Land Cover project: to develop a flexible yet robust strategy for deploying global systematic observations of the carbon cycle over the next decade.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Indeed, the most successful advances in understanding springs from the combination of data and models for the different domains, wherein results from one domain place valuable constraints on the workings of the other domains.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The strategy for a coordinated system of integrated global carbon cycle observations (Ciais 2010) is first of all carbon crosscut of GCOS, GTOS , and GOOS (GOOS) and secondly an identification of new components not previously identified.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The coordinated system of global carbon observations will be built around complementary core groups of observations to address three themes: fluxes, pools, and processes.",,,0,,,,,,,
The first set of observations enables quantification of the distribution and variability of CO2 fluxes between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere.,,,1,,,,,,,
"As part of this, land cover products are needed to create a combination of satellite observations, backed up by a long-term continuity of measurements, delivering global observations of parameters that are required to estimate surface-atmosphere CO2 fluxes where direct in situ measurements are scarce.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The crucial satellite observations that are required for this are among others: land cover status, disturbance extent and intensity, parameters related to vegetation activity, ocean color.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The second set of observations focuses upon changes in the key carbon pools, one of them being forest biomass.",,,0,,,,,,,
Forest biomass inventories are important for monitoring changes in the above-ground terrestrial carbon pool size.,,,0,,,,,,,
"At present, however, these inventories are primarily designed to quantify the volume of merchantable wood in a given region with high accuracy (standard error of 1% at the national level).",,,0,,,,,,,
This quantity relates in a predictable manner to carbon stored in tree biomass.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Allometric equations relating biomass to diameter, height and tree age factors are needed to convert these volume estimates into whole tree carbon content.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Using constant conversion/expansion factors, as is usually done, results in large errors, since both wood density and expansion factors vary considerably with age and between species.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Further, conversion of volume increment obtained from repeated inventories into carbon sequestration needs an extra set of expansion factors that take into account differences in turnover rates of different plant organs.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Much work has yet to be done to create continuous, standardized, geo-referenced forest biomass and soil carbon inventories.",,,0,,,,,,,
"It is critical to harmonize the widely varying methodologies for inventory and analysis, in order to synthesize carbon estimates based on national forest inventories.",,,1,,,,,,,
"In addition, a major observational challenge is to establish allometric functions converting above-ground biomass to total biomass.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Further work is also needed to expand the coverage over non-commercial forests and woodlands, over tropical forests, and to develop satellite technology (LIDAR or Radar) for remote sensing of biomass.",,,0,,,,,,,
SAR data are expected to contribute to estimating biomass.,,,0,,,,,,,
"There is a need to build systematic, repetitive, spatially homogeneous and well coordinated global observation strategies for forest mapping by high resolution SAR.",,,0,,,,,,,
The third set of observations in the system is measurements related to important carbon cycle processes.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Most of these will remain in the research domain, to be coordinated within the framework of the Global Carbon Project.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Two process-related observations, however, are more appropriate for the operational domain and will become part of the core set of the system.",,,0,,,,,,,
These can be monitored by using land cover products.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Fire distribution (hot spots) and burned area extent, to estimate the fluxes of carbon that are emitted during fires.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Fire hot spots will be measured on (sub) daily time steps, with fire extent at monthly intervals.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Land-cover change, to estimate the fluxes of carbon associated with forest clearing and reversion of agricultural lands to natural ecosystems.",,,0,,,,,,,
The sampling interval will be 5 years with a spatial resolution of 1 km.,,,0,,,,,,,
The land-cover change observations should also emphasize forest/non- forest transitions at higher spatial resolution (25 m).,,,0,,,,,,,
The ultimate goal of the coordinated system of global carbon observations is to generate data products that are of value for the user communities.,,,0,,,,,,,
"To create usable products, in situ measurements from a variety of sources need to be integrated with remote-sensing observations within a modeling framework.",,,0,,,,,,,
"To achieve this, a major challenge is to collect, process and harmonize in situ data from diverse sources.",,,0,,,,,,,
"At present problems with in situ data include, among others, inconsistent parameter definitions, incomplete data, differing spatial and temporal scales and sampling bias in measurements.",,,0,,,,,,,
The broad user survey aimed at obtaining user requirements coming not directly from climate modelers but the “climate concerned” users such as those making use of land cover information for other societal benefits or national reporting and accounting.,,,0,,,,,,,
This group represents the broad land cover data user community.,,,0,,,,,,,
The broad user survey consisted of 12 closed questions and was online for a period of 21 days (24th Sept. 2010 to 15th Oct. 2010).,,,0,,,,,,,
The user survey was send to the list of registered GlobCover users with more than 8000 addresses.,,,0,,,,,,,
This group is perhaps currently the most active global land cover user community and quite suitable for border user requirements since the Land Cover CCI activities are building upon the GlobCover heritage.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The total number of answered surveys was 372, from which 79 were only partially answered.",,,0,,,,,,,
These partially completed surveys are only included in the results for the completed answers.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In Figure respondents is working in a University/ Research institute, and 21% is working in the commercial sector (Figure 8).",,,0,,,,,,,
"The applications where the respondents use the GlobCover product for are mostly in the field of natural resources (28%) and Information technology/GIS (27%) followed by Remote Sensing (19%), Climate/ Meteorology/ Hydrology (16%), and Cartography (10%).",,,0,,,,,,,
"In general, the majority of the respondents (70 %) indicate that the required spatial resolution of the land cover products should be smaller than 300 m (Figure 9).",,,0,,,,,,,
For 20% of the respondents the current global standard spatial resolution (300-1000m) would be sufficient.,,,0,,,,,,,
"When looking at the application type, climate users tend to prefer a coarser spatial resolution while users working in the field of natural resources prefer a more detailed resolution.",,,0,,,,,,,
"On the question in what frequency updated versions of land cover products should be available, 70% of the respondents replied that a yearly update would be sufficient, while 27% of the respondents replied that a product every 5 years would be sufficient and only 8% of the respondents requires an update every 10 years (Figure 10).",,,0,,,,,,,
Users from the natural resources field prefer a less regular update frequency compared to the other applications fields.,,,0,,,,,,,
"With regard to defining classification requirements, the question was asked which land cover classes are most important for the application case of the respondent.",,,0,,,,,,,
"From the results (Figure 11) it can be seen that most respondents are interested in all classes with no particular emphasis, while the tree classes are most important as an individual land cover class followed by agriculture, urban and wetlands.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In the field of land dynamics monitoring, the respondents are most interested in forest change monitoring (52% of the respondents), followed by urbanization and urban sprawl(23%).",,,,0,,,,,,
"Of those respondents who disagreed with the use of LCCS as classification system, some of them suggested to use a classification based on the Corine Land Cover product.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Comments on the use of LCCS were mainly on the (fuzzy) way in which the classes are defined, and a need for greater sensitivity to different vegetation classes in the LCCS.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Concerning the question on the preferred technique for downloading and the preferred file formats in which the land cover products should be available in the (near) future, the use of FTP servers in combination with GEOTIFF file formats or HTTP servers in combination with GEOTIFF formats was given as the preferred data access and delivery method (more than 90% of replies).",,,,0,,,,,,
"Torrent servers and HDF-EOS, and NetCDF file formats are significantly less popular to use for data access and delivery.",,,,0,,,,,,
The key user consultation for the product specifications includes the partners and processes directly involved or associated with ESA through CMUG and being partner in the Land Cover CCI project.,,,,0,,,,,,
The objective of this key user consultation was to provide detailed requirements on land cover data characterization as defined by the key users of the project.,,,,0,,,,,,
"This is done by (1) actively engaging in the CMUG process (2) organizing and implementing a key user interaction and product specification meeting to finalize the Land Cover CCI product characteristics as dialog among users (implemented primarily through meetings) and producers and (3) conducting a detailed user survey on the specific requirements for land cover data characteristics to be used in the key and associate user models (spatial, temporal, thematic detail, accuracy requirements).",,,,0,,,,,,
"ESA has established the ""Climate Modeling User Group"" (CMUG), to place a climate system perspective at the centre of the CCI program, and to provide a dedicated forum through which the EO Data Community and Climate Modeling Community can work closely together (see also CMUG In a recent climate requirement baseline document (CMUG 2010), CMUG states that global land cover and land cover dynamics is an important variable for global and regional climate modeling over many time scales.",,,,0,,,,,,
Land cover information is used in climate models for the initialization as well as a boundary condition.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Besides this, detailed regional land cover information provides very valuable information for process studies like e.g. the assessment of the impact of fires.",,,,0,,,,,,
"For land cover monitoring, CMUG defined several requirements for future land cover products.",,,,0,,,,,,
"CMUG recommends that despite the fact that land cover data provides essential spatial patterns of different land cover types, land cover classes have to be translated into model relevant surface parameters that can be used in the model equations.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Concerning the translation of land cover data into model parameters, it is recommends to make use of literature data (Hagemann 2002) or remote sensing based climatologies like ECOCLIMAP (Champeaux et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
These methods and conceptual frameworks are according to research done by CMUG (CMUG 2010) used by most climate and earth system modelers.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Furthermore, GMUG expresses the need to have a land cover product that is consistent with surface parameters datasets and needs to match albedo, fapar, etc.",,,,0,,,,,,
"A variety of different global land cover products already exist (e.g. GLOBCOVER, MODIS) for limited time periods, but these products lack consistency in time.",,,,0,,,,,,
CMUG also recommends combining land cover information with observed variability of land surface characteristics which would be essential to improve the description of land surface dynamics in climate models.,,,,0,,,,,,
"While methods have been developed to retrieve consistent land surface parameters from satellite data these have not yet been combined with high resolution land cover information to generate a consistent, remote sensing based, land surface parameter data set which can be used as a boundary condition in climate models.",,,,0,,,,,,
The Land cover CCI should aim at delivering a product meeting these requirements with a possible extension of the approach to longer timescales and an appropriate error characterization.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The key user survey was performed during September and October 2010, and consisted of 27 questions (mostly open questions).",,,,0,,,,,,
Six key-users from three organizations representing 4 climate models were consulated for this survey.,,,,0,,,,,,
"All three organizations (Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M), the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l’Environnment (LSCE) and the Meteorological Office Hadley Center (MOHC)) are also participating in the Climate Modelling User Group (CMUG) of ESA CCI.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The answers to the questions were divided in answers on land cover product requirements for three different time-frames: (a) current status/used in current models, (b) requirements as needed to improve current modeling practices, and (c) requirements needed in 5 years time, also considering new modeling approaches.",,,,0,,,,,,
"According to agreements made during land the Cover CCI kick-off meeting and to reflect the CMUG need that land cover data have different types of uses for climate modeling, the survey was divided in 4 different themes: (1) General land cover requirements for climate modeling, (2) Land cover as proxy for land surface parameters (3) Land cover as proxy for human activities, and (4) Land cover for validation of model outcomes.",,,,0,,,,,,
Specific questions were formulated to assess the requirements for all these elements.,,,,0,,,,,,
The complete key user survey is presented in Appendix C. From the survey results it can be concluded that the key users that were consulted have a broad interest in earth system/ climate modeling and thereby represent to a broad extend the climate / earth system modeling community.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Their main interest is in carbon (stock) modeling, vegetation modeling, plant- soil-carbon modeling, nutrient-cycling modeling and coupled earth system modeling (e.g. atmosphere- ocean-biosphere modeling).",,,,0,,,,,,
The most popular land cover products and –data that are currently used or have been used by the key users are developed in the time-frame 2000-2005 (Figure.13) but also older products are still commonly applied.,,,,0,,,,,,
The most frequently used dataset is the IGBP Discover and GLCC as provided by USGS.,,,,0,,,,,,
"However, for most model application a combination of land cover datasets is adopted.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This document is the property of the LAND_COVER_CCI partnership, no part of it shall be reproduced or transmitted without the express prior written authorisation of UCL-Geomatics (Belgium).",,,,0,,,,,,
The consistency of the current land cover data with the key-users’ model requirements received a varying rating ranging from sufficient to rather insufficient.,,,,0,,,,,,
"For example, the matching-up of datasets created in different periods according to different classifications is described as a problem concerning the consistency of current land cover data with the key-users’ model requirements.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Linked to these difficulties concerning land cover product classifications, the main reason of interoperability problems is identified in different definitions being used for key-attributes in datasets and models.",,,,0,,,,,,
Also differences in spatial and temporal resolution are regarded as reasons for interoperability problems.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Furthermore, the allocation of model parameters and the transformation of land cover data to other information, due to interpolation issues, remains a source of inaccuracy.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Regarding classification, a major issue is that the assignment of a given biome to a certain Plant Functional Type (PFT) is not at all straightforward.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Even if for example the Olson classification (1994a, 1994b) is used this remains an issue since common PFT types are not directly represented in land cover products, especially with regard to crops (C3, C4), grasses (C3,C4) and wetlands.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Due to these classification and resolution (temporal and spatial) problems, difficulties and inaccuracies arise in attempts to create combined datasets for running climate models if datasets for the historic period and present day situation are combined used as model input for studies on future scenario’s.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The accuracy of the land cover product for continental/ regional scale modeling is regarded as poor, for the global scale modeling it is regarded as moderately sufficient.",,,,0,,,,,,
"For one user where models are applied to different spatial extends, the accuracy of the land cover products is rated very good to moderate.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Going from current to future model requirements, a trend towards an increase in required spatial resolution of land cover datasets can be identified (Figure 14).",,,,1,,,,,,
"However, the magnitude of the spatial resolution required differs for models at different scales.",,,,0,,,,,,
"For example for global applications, future requirements for spatial resolutions of 1 km were mainly mentioned in agreement with currently available global datasets.",,,,0,,,,,,
"However, for specific local to regional applications, spatial resolutions up to products over the coming 5 years (Figure 15).",,,,0,,,,,,
For current models including improvements there is a general agreement on a yearly update with a detailing in seasonality.,,,,0,,,,,,
"However, the introduction of new modeling approaches will require temporal frequencies for some classes up to a monthly resolution.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Furthermore, in order to improve current models and feed improved model approaches within 5 years, higher demands are put on the temporal ranges available of input data.",,,,1,,,,,,
"For some global models, temporal ranges up to 10.000 years will be required.",,,,1,,,,,,
"To produce accurate model output with relatively short simulation steps, historical data of high quality (spatial and temporal resolution) is required.",,,,1,,,,,,
This sets the requirement for land cover data to 250-100 year historical data for global modeling purposes and yearly to half yearly data for modeling where crop rotations are taken into account.,,,,0,,,,,,
The key users each have their own approach in translating land cover classes to plant functional types (PFTs) and vise versa.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In some models, the Olson major ecosystem types (1994a, 1994b) are indirectly being used for defining PFTs as the land surface parameters are based on their distribution from the associated USGB dataset.",,,,0,,,,,,
"In Figure 16, relative importance on which PFTs are used for land cover classification is displayed, and which PFT classes need to be incorporated and extended in future modeling approaches.",,,,0,,,,,,
Some key users pointed out that within 5 years time classification schemes must be created that can deal with wetlands and especially with permafrost classification.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Besides the use of land cover products to estimate the total area under a certain PFT, land cover product can also be used to determine land surface parameters.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Examples of these land surface parameters mentioned by the key-users are: Albedo (surface, vegetation, snow), Vegetation roughness, vegetation fractions, Leaf Area Index, total soil water holding capacity, canopy height.",,,,0,,,,,,
"In case the key-users use and/ or require multi-temporal land cover data for parameter estimations, the preferred seasonally.",,,,1,,,,,,
"With regard to the monitoring of land dynamics triggered by human activities, the main interest lies in the topic of conversions between different land cover types resulting in e.g. urbanization, deforestation.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Furthermore the interest of the key-users in human induced land dynamics lies in the field of specific agricultural land management practices and crop rotations, anthropogenic fire activities and land management practices as irrigation.",,,,0,,,,,,
"A trend towards an increased frequency of available land cover products required for tracking human activities and land use change observations considering the frequency currently available, expected to be required to improve current modeling practices and the resolution needed in 5 years when new modeling practice are considered can be seen in fig.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The thematic information that is of most importance for describing human activities and disturbances are currently classes describing different land use types focusing on crop types (C3, C4) and grassland.",,,,0,,,,,,
"For future modeling practices on defining human activities and land cover dynamics, the following land cover classes will become important : crop and pasture/ grassland varieties (C3, C4), irrigated areas, forest, urban areas, specific agricultural land management practices and fire activity.",,,,1,,,,,,
In Table 6 the model parameters are represented that are (expected to be) validated using land cover products and related observational data.,,,,0,,,,,,
For each of the above mentioned parameters that would be validated using land cover data (Table 6) more specific information is provided on the level of detail required of the land cover product (Table 7).,,,,0,,,,,,
"Besides land cover datasets, other datasets can be of great importance for modeling practices.",,,,0,,,,,,
These datasets should be consistent with land cover datasets.,,,,0,,,,,,
The most important datasets for modeling practices except from land cover products were: Digital elevation model, Water use, Soil data, photosynthetically active radiation (FaPaR), Biomass, Leaf area index (LAI), Fire disturbance and Soil moisture data.,,,,0
"Also, more information on the character of the urban landscape is required.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Concerning data access and data delivery, all responding key users agreed on the latitude/ longitude system as preferred cartographic reference system of land cover products.",,,,0,,,,,,
Also the data format that is most convenient for land cover products was suggested uniformly as NetCDF.,,,,1,,,,,,
"For land cover data delivery, the most popular delivery method is identified as the FTP server or a combination of web services and a FTP server.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The current data retrieval process of input data is regarded as easy to moderately easy, however, it is also d that this is very data dependent.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The relationship between land cover types and model parameters is one of the most important issues determining the accuracy and relevancy of land cover data for parameterization, calibration and validation of climate-related models.",,,,0,,,,,,
"As described in the previous sections, land cover data are commonly used to consistently estimate quantitative land surface parameters.",,,,0,,,,,,
The CMUG user requirements document (CMUG 2010) addresses this issue and mentions the work of Hagemann (2002) as one basis to provide a better quantitative understanding why and on what level of detail and accuracy climate users require thematic land cover information.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In Hagemann (2002) a series of nine land surface parameters are derived from the Olsson land and ecosystem map (1994a, 1994b) using literature data and expert analysis.",,,,0,,,,,,
We used these data to analyze the relative importance of different land cover classes for estimating model parameters.,,,,0,,,,,,
The importance of each differentiating two land cover classes is reflected in the relative similarity for each actual land surface parameter value.,,,,0,,,,,,
The similarity value is reported in percent with 100% representing the same parameter value for this pair of classes.,,,,0,,,,,,
The result is a symmetric matrix of 75x75 classes for each of the nine surface parameters.,,,,0,,,,,,
These large matrices contain important information but will be presented here as selected and aggregate results.,,,,0,,,,,,
For different land surface parameters the pattern of class similarity is rather different.,,,,1,,,,,,
"For Albedo, there are a few classes that obviously have a very different value (Snow, ice, water) than many of the other classes that are relatively similar.",,,,1,,,,,,
"For the forest ratio, there is more of an equal distribution among the range of similarity values.",,,,1,,,,,,
This highlights that the relative importance and thus accuracy of land cover categories for model parameterization varies depending on what model parameter is estimated from the data.,,,,1,,,,,,
A single overall accuracy for a land cover map value will not be able to provide the information on how accurate a specific map is for parameter estimation.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The Olsson map provides a series of categories with more or less consistent thematic definition drawing from land cover and vegetation types, climatic conditions, different levels of mixed classes and others.",,,,0,,,,,,
To provide some information we have grouped the classes into major land cover categories used for previous global land cover comparison studies and somewhat reflecting the GTOS requirements for land cover (Herold 2008).,,,,1,,,,,,
The areas with pink table cells have the highest average similarities among all land surface parameters.,,,,1,,,,,,
There is a tendency that they are located near the diagonal of the matrix reflecting somewhat the ranking of classes 1-12 from Forests to barren and water areas.,,,,0,,,,,,
Most dissimilar are the non-vegetated and vegetation classes.,,,,0,,,,,,
A misclassification and confusion between two classes with large similarity will cause a much lower error in the quantitative parameter estimation than uncertainties among very dissimilar classes.,,,,1,,,,,,
A group of 85 users from the climate modeling community was approached to fill in an online survey on their user requirements for current and future land use data requirements.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The survey was performed in October 2010, and consisted of 16 questions (Appendix B).",,,,0,,,,,,
"For a selection of the questions, land cover product requirements for two time periods needed to be selected: (1) current status/used in current models, and (2) requirements needed in 5 years time, also considering new modeling approaches.",,,,0,,,,,,
"In addition, land cover requirements were assessed for four different climate model aspects as presented in section 3.3.1 for the key user assessment: (1) land cover requirements, land cover as proxy for land surface parameters (3) land cover as proxy for human activities, and land cover for validation of model outcomes.",,,,0,,,,,,
Selection of the group of so-called associated users was based their role as being main developers for a certain type of climate or earth system model (Appendix D).,,,,0,,,,,,
"From the population of 85 users, 15 filled in the questionnaire resulting in a response rate to the associate survey of 18% from a broad range of countries all over the globe.",,,,0,,,,,,
The results of the associate user survey show that land cover data are applied for a broad range of climate modeling applications (Figure 18).,,,,0,,,,,,
Respondents were mostly applying their models at global scale (53%) or national scale (27%).,,,,0,,,,,,
A broad set of different available land cover datasets are used where the most frequently mentioned are the IGBP Discover and GLCC datasets as provided by USGS and FAO statistics (Figure 19).,,,,0,,,,,,
The results also show that in many cases land cover datasets for different coverage periods are combined to derive a time-series of land cover development.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In general, the accuracy of the land cover product for climate model application is judged as moderate till good.",,,,0,,,,,,
The user requirements for the spatial resolution reflect more or less the model application at global and national scale with preferred grid size of 100m and 0.5 degrees respectively (Figure 21).,,,,0,,,,,,
"Looking at requirements for climate modeling application in 5 years, the results show that a more detailed spatial resolution is required but still the global model applications will use resolutions between 0.25 and 0.5 degrees.",,,,0,,,,,,
Temporal resolution requirements for current model application are mainly on a yearly basis with some preference for high-frequency data up till daily but and for global applications with an update frequency from 5 till 10 years (Figure 22).,,,,0,,,,,,
"However, there is a clear future need for more seasonal products with a quarterly till half year temporal resolution which would be able to track the seasonality of agricultural crops and forest ecosystems.",,,,0,,,,,,
User requirements for the thematic aspect of land cover datasets indicate that agricultural classes are very important while also for current modeling applications natural vegetation classes (forest and herbaceous) are seen as important (Figure 23).,,,,0,,,,,,
"However, for future modeling application it is anticipated that a proper representation of urban and wetland classes will become more relevant.",,,,0,,,,,,
This agrees with the results of the key-user survey.,,,,0,,,,,,
"When looking more specific at information requirements on human activities/disturbances or dynamics (Figure 24), the outcome of the survey shows that currently forest loss, agricultural expansion and vegetation phenology are important processes which are taking into account in the initialization or evaluation step of the climate models.",,,,1,,,,,,
"For the next generation models, aspects wetland dynamics, urban expansion and long-term vegetation development will become important processes to take into account.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Within the modeling process, land cover products are also adopted to determine land surface parameters which are then use to initialize the climate models.",,,,1,,,,,,
"For example, Leaf Area Index (LAI) is one parameter that is regularly derived from land cover datasets.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Although several other parameters are already derived from land use data, it is anticipated that especially future climate modeling approaches will increasingly apply this mechanism for parameters like vegetation albedo, vegetation roughness and plant water holding capacity.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Finally, the application of land cover data to validate climate model output was assessed (Figure 26).",,,,0,,,,,,
"For future modeling applications, land cover data will increasingly be adopted to validate net primary production (NPP), albedo and LAI.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Concerning data access and delivery, 50% of the users prefer latitude/longitude as cartographic reference system while in addition a broad range of other systems were mentioned: UTM (Albers), equidistant (Lambert Azimuthal), Transverse Mercator.",,,,0,,,,,,
As most convenient data formats for delivery were mentioned NetCDF (50% of users) and GeoTIFF (45% of users).,,,,0,,,,,,
"For data delivery, FTP (50%) and the combination of web services and FTP (e.g., request via web service and de-livery through FTP) (42%) were mentioned as most frequent options.",,,,0,,,,,,
The broad assessment of existing (climate) models and accompanying user requirements aims at examining how land cover data have been used in climate models and which future needs can be identified for modeling practices.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Below, the results from a standard literature review of key scientific papers published primarily since 2005 is presented.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The performed review focused on current use of land cover data for climate modeling and on the identification of future needs, model requirements and -prerequisites.",,,,0,,,,,,
Special attention is paid to highlight innovative concepts and approaches to better reflect land dynamics in the next generation models.,,,,0,,,,,,
"This review includes different modeling approaches and communities, i.e. Earth System modeling community, Integrated Assessment modeling community and the Impact, Adaptation and Vulnerability community (Hibbard et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
These specific time-frames were selected to make a division between urgent needs and requirements which should be put on the short term agenda and requirements that are still urgent but less pressing.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The results are presented below and are, where applicable, linked to GCOS tasks for land cover as defined in the GCOS implementation plan.",,,,1,,,,,,
Standardization of land cover products with regard to the definitions of classes and their thresholds is an important issue (Jung et al.,,,,0,,,,,,
"This issue is also addressed in the in 2004 defined GCOS Implementation Plan (IP) task 22, which promotes the harmonization of land cover monitoring by creating international standards for land cover maps.",,,,0,,,,,,
"It is widely acknowledged that land data products should ideally be produced by using a hierarchical, standardized land cover classification system which should be applied to validated land cover data and to time-series of data integrated at an appropriate scale (Lepers et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
Land cover products often lack class specific accuracies and categories have large interclass variances (especially for mixed vegetation classes) (Jung et al.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Plant functional types are often used as a basis for class definition (Olson 1994a, b), however more research is needed on the effects of wrong categorization of plant functional types on C:N ratios (Ostle et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
In a more general sense it is stated that parameters must be used that are both mechanistically important and measurable (Ostle et al.,,,,1,,,,,,
This need to validate parameters requires (new) methods for land cover map accuracy assessments (Williams et al.,,,,1,,,,,,
"For example, knowledge about class specific accuracies of the product can, in conjunction with calculated fuzzy agreements be used to generate a map of confidence of the final product (Jung et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Despite of such methods, validation of land cover maps remains an issue as was already addressed in GCOS task 23 (IP 2004).",,,,0,,,,,,
"Even if pre-defined land cover classes are used, as in e.g. land cover products provided by the FAO (Di Gregorio and Jansen 2000), global land cover is often inconsistent with land cover data and actual practices.",,,,0,,,,,,
Accuracy assessment and error reduction should be improved (Williams et al.,,,,0,,,,,,
This point was also raised as part of the 2004 GCOS task 25 ‘development of an in situ reference network for land cover’.,,,,0,,,,,,
Models need to be more obviously comparable to the real world (Friedlingstein et al.,,,,0,,,,,,
This may increase the reliability of for example the model estimated European carbon balance in the future (Vetter et al.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Per definition, it is not possible to correctly interpret carbon cycle simulations if the overall-, user-, and producer accuracy is not known (Jung et al.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Therefore, there is an urgent need for a network of ground and satellite based long term land cover monitoring (Jain and Yang 2005).",,,,1,,,,,,
"Thereby, the benchmarking of global models is a key-procedure and an expanded set of data for evaluation of short timescale dynamics for benchmarking is required (Sitch et al.",,,,1,,,,,,
These datasets can partly be generated by linking optical remote sensing products which provide critical information on e.g. canopy structure and crop phenology (Williams et al.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Furthermore, the scientific community suggested to further expand the FLUXNET tower network to obtain critical data on carbon exchange (Williams et al.",,,,1,,,,,,
Special attention should be paid on the parameterization of albedo and the representation of crop phenology and the representation of evapotranspiration for different land cover types (Pitman et al.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Therefore, the in 2004 defined GCOS task 26 which focuses on the creation of annual land cover products and GCOS task 27 which focuses on the creation of a regular fine resolution land cover (change) map, are still relevant and urgent tasks that should be dealt with on the short term.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Summarizing, on the short term different issues should be addressed to deal with problems regarding the definition of land cover classes; classification of land cover data sets; variation in spatial resolution of the data sources and variation in temporal and spatial coverage of data sets.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Furthermore, earth system model and climate model outcomes should be validated against reference data, preferably using fine resolution land cover datasets that can be provided on a regular basis In the previous paragraph, the short term requirements for earth system modeling and climate modeling as found in key-articles are presented.",,,,0,,,,,,
"In this paragraph, requirements for a more long term (1-5 year) scope are discussed.",,,,0,,,,,,
"More research on model- and data fusion is needed: multiple and different types of data, including associated uncertainties need to be integrated together with prior knowledge on model parameters and/or initial state variables (Ostle et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
"More effort should be put in generating new information by combining existing data, for example by linking Eddy Correlation towers effectively with atmospheric column CO2 measurements generated by satellites like OCO and GOSAT (Williams et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Besides model- and data fusion, there is also a need for an integral vision on the actual (eco)systems that are modeled.",,,,0,,,,,,
"For example for ocean carbon cycle modeling there is a need for more complete treatments of ocean ecosystems, micronutrient limitation, and oceanic acidification impacts on calcium carbonate cycling (Friedlingstein et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
"To advance scientific understanding and enhance data- and model integration, the earth system modeling and integrated assessment modeling communities have to collaborate closely with the remote sensing community (Hibbard et al.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Regarding the use of land cover products as model input, some specific requirements for land cover change monitoring are addressed in literature.",,,,0,,,,,,
"For the location of land cover change detection, land cover should be extended to regions that are not known as hotspots but where rapid changes may still take place and catch the scientific community by surprise (Lepers et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Furthermore, the importance of including land-cover change in forcing scenarios for future climate change studies should be d.",,,,0,,,,,,
"By accounting for a number of additional anthropogenic climate impacts, land cover forcing can be included which will improve the quality of regional climate assessments as e.g. IPCC SRES scenarios (Feddema et al.",,,,1,,,,,,
"In addition, it is stated that without accounting for historical land cover changes, observed atmosphere CO2 growth cannot be explained (Brovkin et al.",,,,1,,,,,,
This implies the need to incorporate historical land cover change into carbon exchange/ stock models.,,,,1,,,,,,
"More research is required on the effects of land cover change on changes in land-atmosphere exchange in greenhouse gases, reactive trace gases and aerosols (Pitman et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Linked to the requirement for earth system modeling to incorporate land cover change, the decline in land suitability due to soil erosion, acidification and salinization also need to be taken into account (Ramankutty et al.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Besides a better understanding of the required model inputs, a more process based understanding of earth system and climate models is needed.",,,,1,,,,,,
There is a need to critically evaluate the representation of plant-soil processes in global models (Ostle et al.,,,,1,,,,,,
Also applied concepts of carbon-water cycle interactions regarding the representation of canopy conductance and soil processes need to be revisited (Jung et al.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In general, a greater process-based understanding of large-scale plant-drought responses and interaction with wildfire and land use is needed and should be filtered in the next generation Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (Sitch et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
"As a part of obtaining more knowledge on the models’ process understanding, more research should be done on model equifinality: where different model representations, through parameters or model structures, yield similar effects on model outputs, and so can be difficult to distinguish (Williams et al.",,,,1,,,,,,
"For the short term, the implementation of several GCOS tasks (task 27 and 28 of the in 2010 defined GCOS tasks) will meet this demand.",,,,0,,,,,,
"For the longer term, the scientific community addresses the need to set up storage and computing facilities to facilitate the collection of all data and provide a web- based interface for data exchange (Jung et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
"As computational power, needed for e.g. millennium scale carbon cycling becomes available some studies can be repeated at different scales and across e.g. a range of different global carbon models (Pongratz et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
"With regard to the FLUXNET network (used as validation for modeling practices where land cover data is used), it is suggested to improve data collecting facilities by nesting Eddy Correlation towers within the regional footprint of tall towers that sample the CO2 concentration of the planetary boundary layer (Williams et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
"For the long term (> 5 years), defined requirements are strongly process based.",,,,1,,,,,,
"For example, the role of nitrogen in earth system modeling should be clarified (Jung et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
Nitrogen supply from soil organic matter is not known accurately and introduces uncertainty (Ostle et al.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Furthermore, potential (in)direct effects of climate change on land use change and land cover change must be made quantitative.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Due to an increase in greenhouse gases the area of land that is cultivable might increase, but yields might decrease.",,,,1,,,,,,
This has to be taken into account in the future for example in a crop productivity parameter.,,,,0,,,,,,
Also the effects of climate change on soil properties need to be accounted for (Ramankutty et al.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Up till now, the effects of land-cover change on climate has been difficult because different bio- geophysical effects offset each other in terms of climate impacts, and, on global and annual scales, regional impacts are often of opposite sign and are therefore not well represented in annual global average statistics (Feddema et al.",,,,1,,,,,,
"In this assessment we have implemented a detailed requirements analysis for a global land cover product that should meet the requirements of GCOS and other international panels, and the climate user community.",,,,0,,,,,,
The study interacted with different types of users through different interaction mechanisms (Figure 27).,,,,0,,,,,,
"Overall, three user surveys were completed for the broad, associated and key users respectively.",,,,0,,,,,,
"While the frequency of responses vary, the amount and quality of feedback is suitable to derive a good synthesis on what climate modeling users need and expect from a new land cover product.",,,,0,,,,,,
"In general, there is quite a good match among the requirements coming from different sources and the broader requirements derived from GCOS, CMUG and other relevant international panels (section 4.1).",,,,0,,,,,,
"In general, land cover has been and remains a fundamental dataset as consistent input to climate models and for the integration of other data sources.",,,,0,,,,,,
"While it is assumed that any new land cover datasets should be better than previous ones and improve climate model and assessment performance, there are several ways land cover feed into different climate applications.",,,,1,,,,,,
It has been emphasized that there is a need for both stable land cover data and a dynamic component (time-series and changes).,,,,0,,,,,,
"Concerning the first item, land cover information act as proxy for a suite of land surface parameters that are assigned based on PFTs.",,,,0,,,,,,
This parameterization is a complex process and is often not redone with every new land cover map and has commonly lead to little innovation in taking up new and updated datasets for climate model applications.,,,,0,,,,,,
Consistency is the key requirement and thus one fundamental (land cover) dataset is the base for series parameters.,,,,1,,,,,,
Some users have stressed that consistency among the different model parameters to be more important than accuracy of individual datasets.,,,,0,,,,,,
This puts more burden on the accuracy of the land cover data since related errors propagate to all parameters.,,,,1,,,,,,
The second item addressing the need to use land cover as proxy for human activities is important to study long-term effects (and feedback) on climate and for the carbon cycle (short-term impact on stocks and fluxes).,,,,0,,,,,,
"Needs were articulated to provide natural versus anthropogenic vegetation (disturbed fraction) and to track human activities and define history of disturbance, i.e. land use affecting land cover with most detail needed for focus areas with large anthropogenic effect.",,,,0,,,,,,
The third issue highlights the needs for the validation of model outcomes or to study feedback effects.,,,,0,,,,,,
More process oriented models need less data for input/calibration but more for validation of outputs.,,,,1,,,,,,
Validation can be regional or local but data must be of high quality and consistent.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Common examples include time series, min/max values of parameters, vegetation types, biophysical variables and others.",,,,0,,,,,,
"There are three types of quantitative requirements provided for the accuracy of the CCI land cover products coming from GCOS, the CMUG and the CCI.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Given the fact that available land cover maps have an overall area weighted accuracy of around 70%, it can be assumed that the accuracy requirements for the land cover CCI should be higher.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Secondly, GCOS requirements mention a maximum of 15 % omission / commission per class, those from CMUG and the CCI an error of 5-10 CMUG further requires stability in accuracies over time of less than 10% (Table 5).",,,,1,,,,,,
The accuracy of the products depends on its actual use in the model.,,,,1,,,,,,
In particular the analysis of the model parameters versus land cover types has emphasized the relative importance of different class accuracies heavily varies depending on which parameter is estimated (section 3.3.3.).,,,,0,,,,,,
This is an important implication that cannot be considered by using a standard overall accuracy reporting.,,,,0,,,,,,
Any accuracy analysis should provide flexibility to account for such differences in how land cover data are used in models and the related impact on the uncertainty of the input data.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The users also stressed the need for quality flags and controls, the probability for the land cover class or anticipated second class or even probability distribution function for each class (coming from the classification algorithm), and the need for accuracy numbers for land cover classes (potentially also with regional estimates).",,,,0,,,,,,
The users provided detailed information on the level of spatial detail they require and the results are summarized in Figure 28 and 29.,,,,0,,,,,,
"First, there is not one spatial resolution that fits all purposes; it is important that the land cover product provides flexibility to serve different scales and purposes.",,,,1,,,,,,
"On average, climate models run on broad spatial levels of detail and a resolution of 300 m or coarser is sufficient to meet modeling requirements for most users.",,,,0,,,,,,
"However, for some and in particular for future periods (see figure 29) there are requirements of more detailed resolutions.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This would mean that land cover observations to estimate model parameters and for description of change would need towards fine-scale satellite observations coming from Landsat- type observations in the coming years (e.g., Sentinel-2).",,,,1,,,,,,
Many users use annual updating of parameters initially derived from land cover data.,,,,0,,,,,,
"While annual data are currently not available for land cover, the modeling community is using interpolation and ancillary data (i.e. from the literature or models) to provide the temporal detail required.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The need for increased temporal resolution data is pertinent among all user groups, in particular for future periods moving into considering intra-annual and monthly dynamics of land cover (Figure 30 and 31).",,,,0,,,,,,
"While any addition to the temporal resolution of the currently often static land cover data is useful, the need to explore the potential of dense remote sensing time series signals is of fundamental importance.",,,,0,,,,,,
"In terms of the temporal range, models use periods beyond the remote sensing era back in time and this range is expected to further increase in the future.",,,,0,,,,,,
"While almost all major land categories in current maps are of importance, Figure 32 particularly highlights the need for forest, herbaceous, and agriculture classes in current models.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Considering all users, the need for wetland and urban classes is expected to increase in future model and other land cover applications.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Given the fact that users require a suite of different types of land cover categories (or plant functional types) for model parameterization that varies with type of model and modeling approach, any land cover product will need to provide some flexibility in responding to these different thematic needs.",,,,1,,,,,,
The broad user survey has shown that more than 90% of the users find the UN Land Cover Classification System a suitable approach for thematic characterization, an approach which is also compatible with the PFT concept of many models and the concept of land cover classifiers.,,,,0,,,,,
C3/C4 grasses and crops and the consideration of human activities and land management practices.,,,,0,,,,,,
"For example, the “disturbed fraction” has been advocated as one of such requirements.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The different functional responses of C3 and C4 plants to nitrogen, radiation, and temperature makes this separation is important.",,,,0,,,,,,
The priority for users is the separation of C3 and C4 grasses, secondly C3/C4 crops.,,,,0,,,,,
"Earlier studies have indicated the potential to derive estimates of the C3–C4 composition of grasslands from satellite sensor data (Foody and Dash, 2007).",,,,0,,,,,,
"In particular, simple measures based on the temporal variation in the spectral response of MERIS images explain 60–65% of the variance in grassland composition.",,,,0,,,,,,
"However, a more recent study showed that MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) composites of the Great Plains in US relationship between MTCI data and grassland C3-C4 composition may be formulated for the State of South Dakota with R2 similar to 0.6 (Foody and Dash, 2010).",,,,0,,,,,,
To reduce the uncertainty for parameters which are derived from remote sensing datasets (i.e. C3/C4 separation) the use of external products or non-satellite derived data maybe needed in addition if it improves accuracy and parameter estimation procedures.,,,,1,,,,,,
"For example, for the models operated at MPI-M (JS-BACH, REMO), all Olson classes (or fractions of), that are transferred into grasses, the separation into C3 and C4 grasses is conducted is based on work by Knorr (1997).",,,,1,,,,,,
The users also stressed the need for data on irrigated rice areas.,,,,0,,,,,,
A fair amount of users (in particular the key users) do not use any change or dynamic products from land cover remote sensing in their current modeling.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In addition, the needs for monitoring wetland dynamics, fire, land degradation and long-term vegetation trends are highlighted by the community of associated users.",,,,0,,,,,,
It is also important to note that about half of the broad user community and one fifth of the associated users did not mention the need for any change/dynamic information.,,,,0,,,,,,
"This re-emphasizes that fact that there is need for both stable and accurate land cover, and dynamic component reflecting time-series and changes.",,,,1,,,,,,
The key climate users for this project were asked for their requirements on meta data and quality control information.,,,,0,,,,,,
"There is need for metadata, including various data required to be made available with the satellite climate data records.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Examples include a timeline of both satellite and instrument related anomalies, documentation on version of level 1 processing, what ancillary datasets have been used in the level 2 processing etc.",,,,0,,,,,,
"An XML document with a well defined schema which clearly defines the instrument, its measurement technique and the analysis method used to retrieve the data record.",,,,0,,,,,,
"CMUG mentions it would be helpful if the schema could, at the top level at least, share some of the structure which has been developed by the EU FP7 project METAFOR to describe climate models and their output.",,,,0,,,,,,
"For example, descriptions of institutions could use the same schema elements.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Next to standard metadata items, some specific requirements were mentioned by the user assessment: 1) validation information: specific areas which were checked with in situ data, and level of agreement with other land cover datasets; 2) clear description of classification methodology and underlying assumptions (e.g., cloud and snow mask); 3) information to support assessment of consistency with other EO derived products (e.g., albedo, vegetation-activity).",,,,0,,,,,,
It was mentioned to add a metric which shows how far the actual pixel value of albedo for example is deviating from the median temporal evolution of the average of the same land cover class.,,,,0,,,,,,
This would allow to identify pixels which are less reliable (representative) and would give the possibility to make sub-classes for these pixels.,,,,1,,,,,,
An alternative could also be to provide the distance of the pixel to the mean of the assigned class in feature space as used by the classifier or even better the probability that the pixel actually belongs to the class it was assigned to.,,,,0,,,,,,
Information on the quality of the land cover products is considered as important to assess the applicability of the products in relation to its application.,,,,0,,,,,,
This information is used to make a choice on which land cover dataset is used in the climate model and for interpretation of climate modeling results in case biases can be related to land cover information in the simulation of associated variables.,,,,1,,,,,,
"At the most basic level, quality information should be available in the form of class accuracy estimates.",,,,0,,,,,,
"As a next step, more spatial explicit quality estimates are required: per pixel probability for a land cover class and the anticipated second class.",,,,1,,,,,,
It was mentioned that the BEAM toolbox as provided through ESA gives the opportunity to make a quick assessment of the quality of data products.,,,,0,,,,,,
"However, to include these variables into climate models more adequate formats would be required which allow usage in scripting.",,,,1,,,,,,
"From the user information available, the key climate users require NetCDF as format, while the broad users and a bit more than 40 % of the associated users require GEOtiff as suitable data format to meet their needs (Figure 34).",,,,1,,,,,,
The use of a geographic lat/lon coordinates is proposed as spatial reference system.,,,,0,,,,,,
Data access through FTP (also combined with web services) is the preferred option for the climate user community (Figure 35).,,,,0,,,,,,
The needs from the GCOS Implementation Plan tasks are well considered by the CCI land cover project and the accuracy requirements are taking into account (see section 4.1).,,,,0,,,,,,
GCOS recently published a set of principles for monitoring of Essential Climate Variables that should be taken up the CCI project and the product specification.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In this study, it is assumed that the a detailed survey and interaction with climate users is one of the key next step in specifying details for monitoring land cover as Essential Climate Variable.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This effort is building upon the guidance from international panels, such as GCOS, and strategy documents but the detailed requirements from the climate user community now offer the next level of detail to start to specify product characteristics.",,,,0,,,,,,
"One of the key conclusions from the survey is that despite differences in needs between the users targeted in the assessment, there is quite some congruency on what is required by the GCOS IP tasks, and the broader requirements by GTOS, IGOL, IGCO, and the scientific literature review, and the detailed user needs.",,,,0,,,,,,
All have been described and documented in this report.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Not only from the literature review it is obvious that climate science is moving more towards modeling the climate system incorporating human influence, impact assessment, vulnerabilities, and policy support.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This direction necessitates a much stronger of the land component in terms spatial, temporal and thematic detail and related requirements for land cover and land use data.",,,,1,,,,,,
Next generation land cover observation data are not only expected to feed into existing models but are expected to stimulate new and innovative modeling approaches beyond the current state of the art.,,,,0,,,,,,
Land Cover has been selected as one of 11 ECVs which will be elaborated during the first phase of ESA Climate Change Initiative (2010-2013).,,,,0,,,,,,
"In order to provide a comprehensive overview of the user requirements for the different ECVs, ESA has provided a standard template for presentation.",,,,1,,,,,,
Below the summary for the Land Cover ECV user requirements is provided according to this template.,,,,0,,,,,,
The land cover products will be projected in a Plate-Carrée projection with a geographic Lat/Long representation (WGS84 ellipsoid).,,,,0,,,,,,
The coordinates will be specified in degrees/minutes/seconds.,,,,0,,,,,,
Possibility to reproject the land cover product to model-specific projections should be included.,,,,0,,,,,,
"An XML document with a well-defined schema (CMUG to help to specify) which clearly defines the satellite data, processing, measurement and monitoring techniques and the analysis method and quality information used to retrieve the data record.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Specific requirements include: 1) validation information: specific areas which were checked with in situ data, and level of agreement with other land cover datasets; 2) clear description of classification methodology and underlying assumptions (e.g., cloud and snow mask); 3) information to support assessment of consistency with other EO derived products (e.g., albedo, vegetation-biophysical variables).",,,,0,,,,,,
"Trend monitoring and tracking human activities, i.e. land use affecting land cover; Validation of model outcomes (i.e. time series) or to study feedback effects.",,,,0,,,,,,
There is a need for both stable land cover data and a dynamic component (time-series and changes).,,,,1,,,,,,
"An user consultation mechanism was set-up to actively involve different climate modeling groups by setting out surveys to different type of users: 1) a group of key-users, most of them also participating in CMUG, 2) associated climate users who are involved and leading the development of key climate relevant models and application, and 3) the broad land cover data user community reflected in the scientific literature and represented by users of the ESA GlobCover product.",,,,0,,,,,,
The evolution of requirements for these aspects from current models to future new modeling ap- proaches was specifically taken into account.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Next to the surveys, requirements from the GCOS Im- plementation Plan 2004 and 2010 and associated strategic earth observation documents for land cover (GTOS, IGOL, IGCO, CMUG) were considered and integrated.",,,,0,,,,,,

This document formally describes the user requirements for the conceptual model of a modular emulator.,,,,0,,,,,,
"It is intended for review by the project manager at the Nationaal Archief of the Netherlands (NA), project member of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek, National Library of the Netherlands (KB), as well as the coordinator of the development team at Tessella Support Services plc.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The emulation report [EMU], written by the KB and NA in 2005, proposes construction of the modular emulator in three separate stages, with each stage specifying different user requirements.",,,,0,,,,,,
"For efficiency reasons, a different approach has been presented by Tessella.",,,,1,,,,,,
"However, the user requirements of both approaches are identical.",,,,0,,,,,,
This document describes the requirements for the final concept of the modular emulator.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Where necessary, user requirements defined in different stages will be identified as such.",,,,1,,,,,,
There are components described in the final concept that build upon results achieved in the previous stages.,,,,0,,,,,,
"As the work has a research element, and project decisions will be made based on produced results during the project, it is difficult to estimate precisely how long the development of each stage will take.",,,,1,,,,,,
"As a result, the implementation of these components will depend on time available.",,,,1,,,,,,
Requirements for these modules are marked “O” (optional) and “E” (extensions).,,,,0,,,,,,
"This does not imply they are not part of the scope of the project, but they will be determined at a later stage.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The Software Requirements Document, specifies the behaviour of the software system.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The User Requirements Document, catalogues the users’ requirements for the system (this document).",,,,0,,,,,,
These digital objects are currently accessed via a standard computer system.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In this project, a model of the standard computer system, the Reference Workstation (RWS), will be used; its capabilities reflect those of the standard computer system.",,,,0,,,,,,
For background on emulation the reader is referred to [EMU].,,,,0,,,,,,
Definitions of technical terminology and jargon common to emulation and used in this document are included in the Glossary in Appendix A.,,,,0,,,,,,
This document lists requirements for the conceptual model of a modular emulator.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Several emulators exist, most notably Bochs and QEMU, but neither implement an emulator with the same objective as desired in this project (see section 2.2).",,,,0,,,,,,
"As both these systems are open source, and fall under the GNU Lesser General Public License, they can be used as a starting point for creating the emulator specified in this project.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The project consists of a number of stages, and will produce several versions during the course of development.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Many of these versions should function as independent products, and will be used to assess the progress of the project and to determine the project’s course.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The final product will depend on the approach used to achieve the most successful results; it is recognised that depending on the approach taken, not all user requirements may be met at the end of the project.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Using the ‘software-emulation-of-hardware’ approach [EMU], the software will be capable of reproducing, as closely as possible, the hardware environment of the Reference Workstation.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The priorities of this reproduction are, in order, execution speed, graphics, sound and network.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The functional behaviour of the system of the software, compared to the RWS, will be assessed using various digital test objects.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Ideally, the system will consist of distinct modules that emulate specific RWS hardware components.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Once an initial version of the system is produced that fulfils the above capabilities, it will be extended with a library of emulated components, and a controller to interconnect these components.",,,,1,,,,,,
"This will make the system capable of emulating multiple environments, besides that of the RWS.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The hardware properties of each emulated components will be specified in a Module Specification File, while particular combinations and usage of the components that make up the environment of an emulator will be specified in an Emulator Specification Document (ESD).",,,,1,,,,,,
The ESD can be associated with stored digital objects to easily access them in the required environment.,,,,0,,,,,,

The target group of the software product is end-users of computer software.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Their intent is to run software packages to access, read and write various digital objects, including interactive multimedia applications, PDF documents, and database systems.",,,,0,,,,,,
These objects may no longer be supported on current hardware and software systems.,,,,0,,,,,,
"This raises the need to install older, unsupported operating systems in order to run the software packages necessary for accessing the digital objects.",,,,1,,,,,,
The group can be classified as users with computer experience varying between minimal and knowledgeable.,,,,0,,,,,,
Those with minimal computer experience will have no knowledge how to install operating systems or software packages.,,,,0,,,,,,
"They will need to be provided with a complete, existing environment that is targeted towards the documents they want to access, shielding them from requiring inside knowledge of the emulator.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Assuming they have developed some familiarity with the environment through continual use, simple interaction can be expected to load, read, write and save the requested objects.",,,,1,,,,,,
"More experienced users can be expected to install the operating systems required for document access, as well as installation of software packages, once provided with the correct environment.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Accessing more complex objects, more involved interactions within the system can be expected, resulting in higher loads to the system.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Knowledgeable users will want to create their own environments on the fly, tailor-made to their needs.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Customising various modules to create specific settings, along with custom installation of operating systems can be expected.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The system will be used to the fullest, placing the highest stress on the system.",,,,0,,,,,,
Interchanging modules within one environment to test and compare settings can be expected to lead to various configurations.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Provided below is a simplified diagram, showing the information and control flows across the system boundary.",,,,0,,,,,,
Virtual Machine creates a dependency on support from the manufacturer.,,,,0,,,,,,

The purpose of the Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to describe the different requirements for the Bank of Zambia’s (BoZ) envisioned Data Reporting and Analytics platform.,,,,,1,,,,,
This document describes what the system would look like from a business perspective and lists critical requirements accurately in a technology-independent manner.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The information has been captured and written through technical support from UNCDF MM4P and signed- off by the relevant stakeholders at BoZ, validating the requirements meet their core business needs.",,,,,1,,,,,
"This document does not include technical and functional design specifications for the BoZ platform, nor provide an analysis of requirements related to systems outside BoZ.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Having validated the structure and contents of the document, the below stakeholders are signing-off on their specific business requirements.",,,,,1,,,,,
The Bank of Zambia (BoZ) is the central bank of Zambia.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The principal responsibilities of BoZ include being banker to government, issuer of currency, manager of foreign exchange reserves, controller of commercial banks' liquidity and with responsibilities for the formulation and implementation of monetary policy.",,,,,0,,,,,
The Bank is active in promoting financial inclusion policy and is a leading member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion.,,,,,0,,,,,
"It is also one of the original 17 regulatory institutions to make specific national commitments to financial inclusion under the Maya Declaration, during the Global Policy Forum, held in Riviera Maya, Mexico in 2011.",,,,,1,,,,,
BoZ has deployed various policies to ensure that financial services are able to make in-roads in remote and rural areas.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Still, financial services are concentrated in mostly urban and semi-urban areas, with capital region of Lusaka having the highest concentration.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Zambia was the earliest adopter of digital financial services (DFS) in Africa in 2002, and the country has made significant improvements over the years in terms of financial services delivery outlets/channels offered through both formal and informal financial institutions.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Despite that, the level of adults Zambians above 18 years who are excluded from financial services remains significant.",,,,,0,,,,,
Data from the Finscope Zambia survey conducted in 2015 showed that only 59.3 % of the population are financially included.,,,,,0,,,,,
The Bank of Zambia realizes the important catalytic role that Digital Financial Services (DFS) can play towards the increased usage of electronic payment mechanisms by the general public.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The Bank of Zambia is therefore working with government and other private and public stakeholders to increase financial inclusion, by increasing access to formal financial services.",,,,,1,,,,,
To this effect the Bank has amongst its strategic objective include plans to increase formal financial inclusion.,,,,,1,,,,,
A number of initiatives have since been put into motion in order to meet this objective.,,,,,1,,,,,
"To ensure integrity of the Digital Financial Services (DFS) sector and enhancing of financial access and usage, Bank of Zambia recognizes it is important that data and measurement tools are deployed for aiding effective supervision and policy making.",,,,,1,,,,,
UNCDF is the UN’s capital investment agency for the world’s 48 least developed countries (LDCs).,,,,,0,,,,,
"With its capital mandate and instruments, UNCDF offers “last mile” finance models that unlock public and private resources, especially at the domestic level, to reduce poverty and support local economic development.",,,,,1,,,,,
This last mile is where available resources for development are scarcest, where market failures are most pronounced, and where benefits from national growth tend to leave people excluded.,,,,,1,,,
Mobile Money for the Poor (MM4P) is a global thematic initiative to address the opportunities and challenges of implementing branchless banking and mobile money in challenging markets in Africa and Asia.,,,,,1,,,,,
"MM4P’s long-term mission is to help low income and rural households in LDCs increase their financial security through appropriate, affordable and secure means to receive, manage and save money through these “digital financial services” (DFS).",,,,,1,,,,,
"DFS refers to a range of formal financial services accessible via digital channels, such as mobile money and agency banking, as opposed to traditional financial services accessed through physically visited at a bank branch.",,,,,0,,,,,
"UNCDF is currently implementing this in eight countries (Benin, Laos, Nepal, Malawi, Myanmar, Senegal, Uganda and Zambia).",,,,,0,,,,,
"In Zambia, MM4P launched its program in March 2015, funded by both MasterCard Foundation, is aimed at increasing active usage of DFS from the current 3% to 36% by 2019 amongst the adult population.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Using the MM4P theory of change, the program seeks to work with all DFS providers, the regulators and the government to achieve this mandate.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The Bank of Zambia is mandated by the Bank of Zambia Act (1996) and the National Payment Systems Act (2007) to ensure that Zambian payment systems are safe, secure, reliable and efficient.",,,,,0,,,,,
"In order to discharge these functions, the Bank needs a robust Data Reporting and Analytics platform (hereinafter “the Platform”) that will support its monitoring and policy making activities.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Consequently, the ‘Banking Currency and Payment Systems Department’ at BoZ, with support from UNCDF Zambia, seeks to deploy a Data Reporting and Analytics platform that would automate the reporting processes and provide analytics useful for policy making.",,,,,1,,,,,
BoZ collects a significant magnitude of data from financial service providers to carry out its regulatory obligations and policy making function.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The transactional data is collected from a range of institutions include banks, non-banks and DFS providers (for list of reporting institutions please see Annexure 1).",,,,,0,,,,,
The present reporting process involves providers manually filling the required regulatory reporting data in a pre-defined excel spreadsheets and emailing it to the BoZ (Banking Currency and Payment Systems Department) within the first week of every month.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Staff at Payment System then collects more than 50 excel files from 34 reporting institutions to manually aggregate the data from these sheets to prepare monthly, quarterly and yearly performance reports.",,,,,1,,,,,
The monthly reporting process takes a dedicated resource nearly a week to complete and an additional week is required when quarter and year-end reports are prepared.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Needless to say, the current process of manually entering, extracting, compiling, aggregating, analysing and reporting data creates numerous challenges for both; BoZ and reporting institutions.",,,,,1,,,,,
"BoZ seeks to implementing a secure, flexible, scalable solution that automates the data collection, analysis and reporting process.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Once the data has been collected and cleansed, it will be stored in a secure database and the analytical functionality would create intelligence in the form of dashboards, visualizations and reports (adhoc & routine).",,,,,1,,,,,
"Where the following sections of the BRD are based on more traditional approach, UNCDF is open to explore solutions that leverage innovative technologies for regulatory reporting, such as blockchain, provided these meet requirements set by BoZ and offers additional advantages in term of functionality and costs.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Presently, BoZ does not have an in-house data centre and there is an abundance of disparate ICT systems which need to be integrated to facilitate information sharing.",,,,,0,,,,,
A key objective under BoZ’s Strategic Plan Technologies to achieve operational efficiency and effectiveness.,,,,,0,,,,,
The Bank in a bid to enhance operational efficiency and effectiveness will implement an Enterprise Architecture (EA) Framework2.,,,,,1,,,,,
The EA Framework will assist the Bank to respond better to its stakeholders by having a method and an organising principle that aligns functional business objectives and strategy with an IT strategy and execution plan.,,,,,1,,,,,
The Bank will also seek to implement greater integration among its information systems by implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform.,,,,,1,,,,,
Some of the benefits of the ERP include reduction in complexity of the Bank's Information Architecture through the establishment of a single platform for the Bank's business systems.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The Bank has plans to an implement ICT Governance Framework, based on the new COBIT 5, to manage how ICTs are managed in the organization.",,,,,0,,,,,
"COBIT 5 encompasses all stakeholders within BoZ and calls for the establishment of an ICT Steering Committee at Board that should make ICT-related decisions, such as which ICT investments to make and what ICT projects to run.",,,,,0,,,,,
Client desktops based on Microsoft Windows 64-bit Operating systems Several Intel quad core processors servers running Windows 20xx 64-bit.,,,,,0,,,,,
The envisaged Data Reporting and Analytics platform will be developed under the supervision and leadership of Bank of Zambia.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Data will be stored in-house on Bank of Zambia servers, the platform would be the CAPEX model in nature with minimal ongoing maintenance and service costs.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The platform will be optimised to collect data from various sources, transforming and cleanse the data into a standardized format, and warehousing the data for analysis and dissemination to users in various formats.",,,,,0,,,,,
"In the ideal scenario the data warehouse could utilize Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) methodologies for analytical analysis and allowing users to construct queries ad-hoc, or “on-the-fly”.",,,,,1,,,,,
The expected architecture of a solution should be sufficient to meet all essential business requirements and offer a coherent set of functionalities.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Furthermore, the platform should allow it incorporate more features as business needs and technology evolves.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Supports popular web-browsers such Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari etc.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The long-term vision of the platform includes straight-through processing of data from reporting institutions with minimal intervention to ensure data accuracy, integrity and timeliness.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In a bid to enhance operational efficiency and effectiveness, BoZ has plans to implement an Enterprise Architecture (EA) Framework.",,,,,1,,,,,
The platform would need to comply with these frameworks and might require integration with infrastructure components as they are deployed.,,,,,0,,,,,
The platform therefore should consider all interdependencies and linkages that will be required as components of the new framework are introduced.,,,,,1,,,,,
Bank of Zambia intends to procure in 2019 an in-house server for this system.,,,,,0,,,,,
It’s specifications will be at a minimum: 8 Core CPU, 16GB Ram, 1 TB Hard Drive (with mirroring or Raid), 5 Mbps Bandwidth, 5 TB External drive for backup.,,,,,0,
The data will need to reside in the Bank of Zambia in-house server as per Bank of Zambia policies and requirements.,,,,,1,,,,,
BoZ seeks to enhance the efficiency of the data collection and analytics to ensure quality and timeliness of data.,,,,,1,,,,,
The platform will provide functionality for managing and restricting system access according to each user group’s access privileges as authorised by BoZ.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Limit access to the platform only to authorised and uniquely identified users by enforce authentication that can be based on combination of user/password or user certificate Manage and monitor privileges of users, allowing them access to features, sensitive data and outputs as per their privileges.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In addition to BOZ, the envisaged platform will be used by a diverse group of stakeholders that include reporting institutions, and other industry actors who might be interested for reasons of transparency, investment or regional or international reporting reasons.",,,,,0,,,,,
"To accommodate the different user groups, the platform will enforce user hierarchies and access controls to prevent unauthorised access to sensitive data and features.",,,,,1,,,,,
"BoZ collects a large amount of data for statistical, prudential and monitoring purposes.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Once the deployed, users from multiple reporting institutions will interact with the platform, through a secure web-based, to enter the required regulatory reporting data.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Before the data is submitted to BoZ, the platform will check input values to ensure conformity to the defined business rules.",,,,,1,,,,,
"If the submitted data/report is in conflict with the business rules, then the platform will display the appropriate error message that will allow user to identify and adjust the erroneous entries.",,,,,1,,,,,
Key critical data elements to be provided to BoZ by reporting institutions can be found in the embedded excel file in the annexures.,,,,,0,,,,,
"To ensure a harmonized model for input data as well as rules for analysis of collected data, the platform should operate as per the criteria and conditions defined by BoZ in the form of Business Rules.",,,,,1,,,,,
"As reporting requirements can evolve with new regulatory priorities, the platform should provide the capability to define and modify business rules through the administrator login.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Apart from increasing efficiency of supervision, a key objective of the platform is the measurement of progress towards Zambia’s financial inclusion goals.",,,,,0,,,,,
"To that end, the platform should be capable of handling complex multi-dimensional data and have robust data analysis and modelling capability would gain a better understanding of the relationships between disparate pieces of data.",,,,,1,,,,,
"This will allow BoZ to proactively manage the DFS sector and gain a better understanding of the relationships between disparate pieces of data, particularly on matters related to gender and youth.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Ability to create totals of different fields by provider and provider types, for specified Ability to perform complex calculations, e.g. percent of total, rolling sums and averages, period comparisons etc.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Ability to perform advanced statistical functions, e.g. standard deviation, variance, skew etc.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The platform will provide additional ad-hoc data access functionality to users so they may run custom queries, according to their access privileges.",,,,,1,,,,,
The platform would have the ability to generate a variety of decision making tools in different formats that would help BoZ and other stakeholders assess the performance of the DFS sector and make strategic decisions.,,,,,1,,,,,
"In addition to generating a set of predetermined reports based on historical trends and future projections, the platform would also create customized reports and share automatically with relevant stakeholder.",,,,,0,,,,,
Sample output being created by BoZ are summarised in annexures 5 for reference.,,,,,0,,,,,
"BOZ warrants that the platform be designed and implemented to a high standard of security and reliability, with the objective of maintaining the integrity, availability and confidentiality of data.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Accessible through web-browsers, the user interface should be windows-compatible and provide access to all platform features and modules.",,,,,1,,,,,
The design should have a high level of usability with a common “look and feel” achieved through consistent Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) for all internal and external users.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Interface consistency includes the use of common command entry syntax, dialog window styles, data entry structures, and information presentation.",,,,,0,,,,,
Incorporate data entry features designed to reduce the amount of direct keying required to enter data.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The platform solution must be scalable upwards and designed using modular architecture to accommodate increasing number of users, sessions, transactions, and analytical reports as need.",,,,,1,,,,,
The developed cloud-based solution needs to ensure adequate security and maintain strict confidentiality of all information provided by stakeholders.,,,,,0,,,,,
"To ensure integrity of the platform, all its components should have all required security certifications and conform to all industry security standards.",,,,,1,,,,,
"All sensitive information such as user/passwords in the database should be stored securely, in encrypted form.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Furthermore, the platform should provide full audit trails for all activities within the system, including system accesses and activities.",,,,,0,,,,,
The platform must be easy to use in order to minimize a chance of human error leading to a malfunctioning of the system.,,,,,1,,,,,
"At the minimum, the platform has to be available to users with official working hours in Zambia.",,,,,1,,,,,
The platform should be able to handle at least 60 users concurrently.,,,,,0,,,,,
"In terms of throughput capacity and response times, the platform should make due allowance for peaks in usage and general growth.",,,,,0,,,,,
"In the ideal scenario, the platform should be capable of creating required reports within 10 seconds and allow replacing the back-end queries to be able to override slow performing queries with optimized queries.",,,,,1,,,,,

This document contains the user requirements for the ODE (Oc´e Datapath Editor) application.,,,,,0,,,,,
This software product is part of the Software Engineering Project (2IP35) at the Eindhoven University of Technology.,,,,,0,,,,,
"These user requirements were established according to requests formulated by Group ODE taking into account the wishes of our customer, Egbert Teeselink, on behalf of Oc´e.",,,,,1,,,,,
"This document complies with the speciﬁcations for a User Requirements Document (URD) by the software engineering standards, as set by the European Space Agency [2].",,,,,0,,,,,
During the project the group will create a tool in which Oc´e’s software engineers can model a datapath.,,,,,1,,,,,
The User Requirements Document (URD) contains the requirements for the Oc´e Datapath Editor (ODE).,,,,,0,,,,,
The document conforms to the ESA document standard [2].,,,,,0,,,,,
These requirements are a negotiated agreement between Oc´e and the project team.,,,,,0,,,,,
"All of the listed requirements, and only these, will be implemented according to their priorities.",,,,,0,,,,,
Any changes to these requirements require the consent of both parties.,,,,,1,,,,,
The ODE Group will provide Oc´e with an editor where the user can model a so called datapath.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The editor will aid the process of choosing the correct hardware, required for the tasks a printer or copier should be able to execute.",,,,,0,,,,,
The ODE will provide a visual environment in which the user can create and change these models and export them for analysis.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The editor will also get feedback from the analysis tools, e.g. highlighting speciﬁc items in a model.",,,,,0,,,,,
The function of the product at Oc´e will be to provide a correctly structured ﬁle for use in Oc´e’s own analysis tool chain.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Because it is irrelevant of which actions the analysis and veriﬁcation tools consist, it is depicted as an abstract “Analysis” object.",,,,,1,,,,,
This section contains a list of deﬁnitions for used acronyms and abbreviations.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The remainder of this document is divided into two chapters, General description and Speciﬁc requirements.",,,,,0,,,,,
The General description gives a clear and concise description of the ODE.,,,,,0,,,,,
"It consists of a short view on the product, a short summary of the general capabilities of the product and a more in-depth view of the main parts of the product: the model editor and the repository.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The Speciﬁc requirements are subdivided in capability requirements, describing what the system should do, and constraint requirements, describing how the requirements should be implemented.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The ODE will provide a graphical interface for designing models representing datapaths, which can be exported and analysed by other software.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The idea of using software to design and analyse datapaths in order to make the engineering of new printers, scanners and copiers easier and faster has been exploited by Oc´e for a while, but they have not been successful at creating a single tool that can generically model any datapath.",,,,,0,,,,,
The analysis and veriﬁcation tools are still in development and the exact representation of data used by veriﬁcation tools has yet to be determined.,,,,,0,,,,,
Deﬁning these standards and using them is beyond the scope of this project.,,,,,0,,,,,
The ODE should provide the user with a visual way of modelling datapaths and it should also allow the user to export this model to a ﬁle for analysis and veriﬁcation.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Besides being easy to use, it is also important that future developers can easily expand its functionality and adapt the input or output format.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The ODE will consist of two parts, the model editor and a repository.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The model editor will provide a visual way to model datapaths consisting of an application part, a platform and a mapping that maps the application onto the platform.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The repository will allow the user to add and edit speciﬁc tasks, algorithms and hardware types in text.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Deﬁnitions for tasks, algorithms and hardware types are given in a later stage.",,,,,0,,,,,
Some deﬁnitions or terms used are listed in the following table.,,,,,0,,,,,
Application node A generic item in the application.,,,,,0,,,,,
Application edge A generic directed edge between nodes in the application.,,,,,0,,,,,
A generic undirected edge between nodes in the platform.,,,,,0,,,,,
A connection between an application node and a platform node.,,,,,0,,,,,
"A project consists of a set of project properties, one application, one platform and one mapping between the application and platform.",,,,,0,,,,,
"An item that can be edited in the repository, either a hardware type, task or algorithm.",,,,,0,,,,,
"This part of the ODE provides a GUI in which the user can model an application, a platform and a mapping that maps the application onto the platform.",,,,,1,,,,,
The entire structure of the model has yet to be deﬁned and is prone to change after this project has been ﬁnished.,,,,,1,,,,,
"However, some details about the structure of various nodes and edges are known and unlikely to change during the course of this project.",,,,,1,,,,,
The application consists of a set of application nodes and edges between these nodes.,,,,,0,,,,,
The edges in the application are directed from node to node.,,,,,0,,,,,
"There will at least be a type of node called step, some kind of start node and some kind of end node.",,,,,0,,,,,
"A task can be assigned to a step, describing the properties of that speciﬁc step (e.g. scan, describing the speed and size of the scan).",,,,,0,,,,,
Applications will generally contain at most 20 nodes.,,,,,0,,,,,
"For example, an application could be visually represented as in Figure 2.1.",,,,,0,,,,,
A platform is an undirected graph consisting of platform nodes and edges between these nodes.,,,,,0,,,,,
These nodes represent the hardware elements that the device will use to physically execute the tasks as deﬁned in the application.,,,,,0,,,,,
There will at least be a type of node called resource block.,,,,,0,,,,,
"A speciﬁc resource can be assigned to a resource block, describing the properties of that speciﬁc resource (e.g. 512 MB RAM, describing the size of the memory).",,,,,0,,,,,
The mapping maps an application onto the platform used to execute it.,,,,,0,,,,,
Each link from an application node to a platform node can have an associated algorithm that is stored within the repository.,,,,,0,,,,,
The algorithm speciﬁes how eﬃcient a task can be executed on this piece of hardware.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The repository is included to allow users to add, edit and remove deﬁned algorithms, resources and tasks.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Within each entry it is possible to add comments about the algorithm, resource or task in question.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Because the export format and the input language are prone to modiﬁcations, it is important that future developers can easily modify the code to comply with new standards.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Besides changes in the export format, it is also probable that the functionality of the product will be expanded.",,,,,0,,,,,
Therefore the quality standards for the source code of the ODE are high.,,,,,1,,,,,
The ODE is not designed to check the semantics of a given model.,,,,,0,,,,,
"However, it may check for basic validity of models created with the ODE and provide constraints within its GUI to prevent some basic syntactical errors.",,,,,1,,,,,
Details of these constraints are given in the SRD [3].,,,,,0,,,,,
There are two types of users that interact with the ﬁnal product.,,,,,0,,,,,
The ﬁrst group is a small group of users that use the actual program to model datapaths.,,,,,0,,,,,
These users have in-depth knowledge of what can be modeled with the product.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The second group of users does not use the product itself, but uses its code to add more features to the editor.",,,,,0,,,,,
These users are also very important since the export format and the product’s required functionality are prone to change.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Obviously, this results in high demands to the quality of the code and architecture.",,,,,0,,,,,
The product will run on computer systems running either Windows XP or Windows 7 as primary operating system.,,,,,1,,,,,
It will only be used by Oc´e’s in-house software engineers.,,,,,0,,,,,
"In order for us to be able to provide a good product, we expect the customer to comply to several requirements.",,,,,1,,,,,
These requirements have been formulated in cooperation with the customer.,,,,,0,,,,,
The language to be used in the models is frozen before the end of the SR.,,,,,1,,,,,
The semantics of the model are provided by the customer to the extent that matters to the editor.,,,,,0,,,,,
The number of constraints inferred by the customer is small.,,,,,0,,,,,
This chapter covers the capability requirements and constraint requirements.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Each requirement consists of a unique identiﬁer, followed by a short description and a priority.",,,,,0,,,,,
Must have: these requirements are essential for the product.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Must haves, meaning they must be implemented if at all possible.",,,,,1,,,,,
Could have: requirements which are not critical to the products success.,,,,,1,,,,,
Any application node and platform node can be selected by the user.,,,,,0,,,,,
It is possible to select any application node or platform node by means of a method call.,,,,,1,,,,,

The user can change the resource assigned to a resource block.,,,,,0,,,,,
The user can move platform nodes within the platform.,,,,,0,,,,,
The user can remove platform nodes from the platform.,,,,,0,,,,,

The user can connect the starting point of a link to a diﬀerent application node.,,,,,0,,,,,
The user can connect the endpoint of a link to a diﬀerent platform node.,,,,,0,,,,,
The editor will assign an algorithm to a link if there is exactly one algorithm available for it.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The user can add an algorithm, resource and task to the repository.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The user can add an algorithm, resource and task to the repository using a fancy wizard.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The user can open an existing algorithm, resource and task in the repository.",,,,,0,,,,,

"The user can modify an existing algorithm, resource and task in the repository.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The user can close an open algorithm, resource and task in the repository.",,,,,0,,,,,
The user can undo any changes made in the text editor of the repository.,,,,,0,,,,,
It should be easy to add syntax highlighting to the repository.,,,,,0,,,,,
Constraints posed by the modeling language are enforced by the ODE.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Every method and class in the source-code is documented using comments, explaining what it does, and how it does this.",,,,,1,,,,,
These comments have to be documented according to standards enforced by the documentation generation tool that the ODE group chooses to use.,,,,,0,,,,,
At least 80% of the methods are functionally cohesive or sequentially cohesive.,,,,,0,,,,,
Every method and variable in the source-code has a clear and verbose name.,,,,,0,,,,,

DOCUMENT APPROVAL Author Release See Document Change Record.,,,,,0,,,,,
This is the TMT Observatory Operations Requirement Document (OPSRD).,,,,,0,,,,,
"It is one of the three systems engineering level one requirement documents, the others being the Observatory Requirements Document (ORD) (RD1), and the Observatory Architecture Document (OAD) (RD2).",,,,,0,,,,,
The three documents are the project’s response to the science requirements encapsulated in the Science Requirements Document (SRD) (RD3) and the Operations Plan (OPSPlan) (RD4).,,,,,0,,,,,
The requirements in the OAD (RD2) will flow down to requirements for the observatory subsystems.,,,,,1,,,,,
"As necessary, new requirements implied by the current document flow down into OAD (RD2).",,,,,1,,,,,
Site-specific implementation plans to fulfill these operational concepts are described in the TMT Operations Plan (OPSPlan) (RD4).,,,,,0,,,,,
"The requirements in this document are numbered in the form [REQ-X-Y-Z], where the placeholders X, Y, and Z dethe level of the requirement, the document the requirement is associated with, and a unique number for the requirement.",,,,,0,,,,,
This numbering scheme allows for unambiguous reference to requirements.,,,,,1,,,,,
This document shall be used as guidance for the top level engineering function and performance requirements of the observatory.,,,,,0,,,,,
The requirements documented in the OPSRD and the ORD (RD1) are intended to fully describe the top-level engineering and operational requirements to satisfy the criteria of the Science Requirements Document (SRD) (RD3) and Operations Plan (RD4).,,,,,1,,,,,
"By this definition, the OPSRD will change in response to changes in the Operations Plan (RD4), but will not require modification when changes are made to the Observatory Requirements Document (ORD) (RD1), Observatory Architecture Document (OAD) (RD2), or to the Subsystem Requirements Documents.",,,,,1,,,,,
The OPSRD shall also be used as guidance for the design and implementation of TMT operations processes and staffing plan.,,,,,0,,,,,
"It is expected that each major TMT subsystem (e.g., AO systems, instruments, enclosure, APS) will have a separate operation concept definition document (OCDD) that describes operations, calibration, and maintenance processes.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Reference documents contain information complementing, explaining, detailing, or otherwise supporting the information included in the current document.",,,,,0,,,,,
Early operations is defined as the period that starts when the first nontechnical facilities are accepted and continues until the observatory has reached steady-state operations.,,,,,1,,,,,
Early science operations are expected to begin during the first 12 months after the M1 has been fully populated and phased for the first time.,,,,,1,,,,,
Steady-state (science) operations is defined as the period that starts 36 (TBC) months after the M1 has been fully populated and phased for the first time.,,,,,1,,,,,
The intervening time is considered sufficient for tuning the performance and operational procedures to the level necessary to meet the requirements in this section.,,,,,1,,,,,
Nighttime is defined as the time between the end of evening nautical twilight and the beginning of morning nautical twilight.,,,,,1,,,,,
"At these points, the center of the sun is 12 degrees below the horizon.",,,,,1,,,,,
"For Mauna Kea, this time interval corresponds to roughly 10 hours per 24-hour period in the mean.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Term Definition Shall ""Shall"" derequirements that are mandatory and will be the subject of specific acceptance testing and compliance verification.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Can/May/Should ""Can"", ""May"", or ""Should"" indicate recommendations and are not subject to any requirement acceptance testing or compliance verification by the supplier.",,,,,1,,,,,
The supplier is free to propose alternative solutions.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Is/Will ""Is"" or ""Will"" indicate a statement of fact or provide information and are not subject to any requirement acceptance testing or verification compliance by the supplier.",,,,,1,,,,,
The development of TMT Observatory operational requirements is motivated by several key measurable metrics of success.,,,,,1,,,,,
The primary metric of scientific impact will be the number of high-impact science papers per unit time.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Conceptually, a high-impact paper contains transformational and/or unique scientific results.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Quantitatively, high-impact papers lie in the upper 1% of all refereed papers ranked by number of citations.",,,,,0,,,,,
The TMT Observatory will endeavor to maximize the production of high-impact science papers based on data obtained with the TMT.,,,,,0,,,,,
"This metric will be evaluated per unit time (i.e. one year, TBC) and over the entire observatory lifetime.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The mean number of citations per refereed paper based on data obtained with the TMT, measured per unit time (i.e. one year, TBC) and over the entire observatory lifetime.",,,,,0,,,,,
The absolute number of papers published per year based on data obtained with the TMT.,,,,,0,,,,,
Citation decay rate as a function of time (a measure of impact longevity).,,,,,0,,,,,
"To maximize scientific success as measured by the metrics above, the TMT Observatory will strive for technical excellence as measured by the following technical success metrics.",,,,,1,,,,,
High-impact papers often result from exploiting unique observatory capabilities.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Such capabilities can lie in the areas of hardware (e.g. largest M1 collecting area, best science detectors), software (e.g. very efficient target acquisition system), or process (e.g. being the first of a new generation).",,,,,0,,,,,
"Conversely, it is well recognized that observatories that do not add new capabilities over time quickly become scientifically irrelevant, often limiting the overall scientific return on the original capital investment.",,,,,1,,,,,
"By design, the TMT Observatory will be first in its class in many areas at the start of operations.",,,,,1,,,,,
"To maintain its lead in as many areas as possible within available funding, the TMT Observatory will execute a vigorous development program during the operations phase.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In particular, this program will endeavor to provide the TMT Observatory with a steady flow of new and unique instruments and AO systems commensurate with the evolving ambitions of the TMT user community.",,,,,1,,,,,
"As the number of science integration hours decreases, so does the potential for transformational observations.",,,,,1,,,,,
These quantities must be minimized – by design as well as by an efficient operational process and a comprehensive maintenance program.,,,,,0,,,,,
"More specific requirements and goals are discussed in Section 3.2, Technical Operations.",,,,,0,,,,,
"As system performance degrades, so does the scientific grasp of TMT and hence its potential for transformational observations.",,,,,1,,,,,
These quantities must be optimized – by design as well as by a comprehensive monitoring and maintenance program.,,,,,0,,,,,
The TMT Observatory shall provide allocation process tools to be used by the partners.,,,,,0,,,,,
The TMT Observatory shall provide partner-share time accounting tools to be used by the partners.,,,,,0,,,,,

Discussion: This process will allow the time used for each observation to be automatically tracked and accounted to each partner’s allocated time.,,,,,1,,,,,
Examples of time tracking policy are given in the discussion points below.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The tracking will account for the amount of bright, gray and dark time used by each partner.",,,,,0,,,,,
"As much as possible, such observations will be limited to nautical twilight at the beginning and ending of each night.",,,,,1,,,,,
Discussion: Calibrations which are specific to an observing program and taken at night will be accounted in PI/partners time.,,,,,1,,,,,
The TMT Observatory shall implement a proposal submission process that accommodates multi-partner collaborations and allows shared observing programs.,,,,,1,,,,,

"The TMT Observatory shall provide the following 2 observing scenarios: 1) remote observing (from headquarters or other physical location) and 2) physical presence, only when physical presence at the summit is essential.",,,,,0,,,,,
The TMT Observatory shall support remote observing using hardware and software systems certified by TMT.,,,,,0,,,,,
The TMT Observatory shall execute service queue observing on behalf of PIs from a combined list of observing blocks from all partners via a scheduling process over six month periods.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Discussion: An adaptive queue which dynamically adjusts to atmospheric conditions from a larger pool of partnership-wide observing programs will not be offered initially, however service queue processes and tools should not preclude this being offered later.",,,,,0,,,,,
The TMT Observatory shall implement an adaptive scheduling process within a single partner’s allocated observing time.,,,,,0,,,,,
These tools are not part of the TMT construction project.,,,,,0,,,,,
The TMT Observatory shall implement an eavesdropping mode that allows the PI to connect remotely during their observation window.,,,,,1,,,,,

"Each OB will contain all the information necessary for TMT Science Operations staff to configure the TMT system for observation execution, e.g. target coordinates, requested guide stars, instrument configuration, etc.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Each OB also contains all the user-specified information necessary for scheduling, i.e. atmospheric conditions, lunar phase, etc.",,,,,0,,,,,
The process will allow for basic information to be entered into the observatory database (Phase I) with further details necessary to perform the observation entered via an on-line tool (Phase II).,,,,,1,,,,,
The data stored in the data base will be directly accessed to prepare the observing queue (ref.,,,,,1,,,,,

Discussion: Scheduled technical time will be publicly announced and taken into account when the observatory science operations schedule is constructed.,,,,,1,,,,,
Discussion: All instruments declared to be operational are expected to have unscheduled technical downtimes commensurate with the above system level requirement.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Any time loss due to failures of the telescope, instruments, adaptive optics systems or science observing software which prevent useful science observing with a reasonable efficiency and performance will be counted as unscheduled technical Downtime.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Some technical faults may mean no science observing can be done, while for others there may be some degraded level of performance which is tolerable.",,,,,0,,,,,
The TMT Observatory available science time on the telescope for observing planning purposes shall be assumed to be 50% of time for seeing limited observations and 50% of the time for diffraction limited observations (using AO).,,,,,1,,,,,

"The mission of the Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) System is to provide continuous high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution observations and geophysical parameters of the Earth / Atmosphere System derived from direct measurements of its emitted and reflected radiation using satellite based sensors from the geo-stationary orbit.",,,,,,0,,,,
"To fulfil its mission it is required to deploy sustained capabilities to acquire, process and distribute to downstream application users and second tier processing centres environmental data on a broad spectral range (from UV to LWIR), covering extensive areas (global and regional), and within a variety of different time scales to continue and enhance the services offered by the Second Generation of the Meteosat System (MSG).",,,,,,1,,,,
"The MTG mission encompasses the following observation missions: Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) mission, providing 16 channels with a spatial sampling distance in the range 1-2km (also called Full Disc High Spectral resolution Imagery (FDHSI)); and/or 4 channels with a spatial sampling distance in the range 0.5-1km (also called High spatial Resolution Fast Imagery (HRFI)).",,,,,,0,,,,
It is possible to configure the FCI to scan the earth disc in 10 minutes in support of the Full Disc Scanning Service (FDSS) or a quarter of the disc in 2.5mn in support of the Rapid Scanning Service (RSS).,,,,,,0,,,,
The combination of channels and coverage areas are defined in the list of products.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The earth disc is split in 4 zones of equal size (called LAC for Local Area Coverage), and numbered LAC 1 to LAC 4, from south to north.",,,,,,0,,,,
The scan pattern repeat sequence is arranged to revisit each LAC zone in a manner adapted to the need of the End Users (Europe is revisited more often).,,,,,,0,,,,
"Lightning Imagery mission is achieved through the Lightning Imager (LI) instrument, detecting continuously over almost the full disc, the lightning discharges taking place in clouds or between cloud and ground with a spatial sampling distance less than 10km at 45 degrees north for the sub-satellite longitude.",,,,,,0,,,,
The Space Segment of the MTG System consists of a satellites constellation.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Three in-orbit satellites are needed to support the complete and total set of missions and functions listed above, the full operational capability (FOC).",,,,,,0,,,,
Each satellite is specified for a nominal lifetime (including commissioning) of ca.,,,,,,0,,,,
"This distribution of the payload complement and redundancies gives regard to the novelty nature of the sounding missions (IRS and UVN) and their respective downstream applications using data from geo-stationary systems, balancing the payload mass distribution, power, consumables such as propellant, and data rates making effective use of the same platform.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Similarly to MSG, the MTG System has the capability to accommodate a GEOSAR transponder, enabling the operations of the mission under the aegis of the COSPAS-SARSAT System.",,,,,,0,,,,
Archived dataset retrieval services continue to be provided as part of the multi-mission EUMETSAT Data Centre services.,,,,,,0,,,,
User support services are enhanced to address MTG as well.,,,,,,0,,,,

A local area scanning is possible with a higher repetition rate (further called rapid scan for consistency with Meteosat first and second Generation).,,,,,,0,,,,
Normal (full disc) and local area scanning can be interleaved on a single satellite (e.g. when only one imaging satellite is operational in orbit) or conducted in parallel when 2 satellites are available in-orbit.,,,,,,1,,,,
These two scanning modes correspond respectively to the Full Disc Scanning Service (FDSS) and Rapid Scanning Service (RSS).,,,,,,0,,,,
"The operational practices for the Full Disc Scanning Service (FDSS), after the launch of MTG-I1, and the Rapid Scanning Service (RSS), after the launch of MTG-I2, are both defined.",,,,,,1,,,,

The potential use of interleaved scanning during routine operations depends on experience in orbit and recommendation of the OPS-WG.,,,,,,0,,,,
The FCI acquires the spectral channels simultaneously by scanning a detector array per spectral channel in an east/west direction to form a swath.,,,,,,0,,,,
The swaths are collected moving from south to north to form an image per spectral channel covering either the full disc coverage or the local area coverage within the respective repeat cycle duration.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Radiance samples are created from the detector elements at specific spatial sample locations and are then rectified to a reference grid, before dissemination to the End Users as level 1 datasets.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Spectral channels may be sampled at more than one spatial sampling distance or radiometric resolution, where the spectral channel has to fulfil FDHSI and HRFI missions or present data over an extended radiometric measurement range for fire detection applications.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The spectral channels VIS 0.6, NIR 2.2, IR 3.8 and IR 10.5 are delivered in both FDHSI sampling and a HRFI sampling configurations, the latter is indicated by #1 in the table.",,,,,,0,,,,
The FCI shall be able to generate images covering the full Earth disc (called full disc coverage (FDC)) and a subset (called local area coverage (LAC)) with the repeat cycle duration and coverage as specified in Table 2.,,,,,,0,,,,

"During the eclipse season the dataset quality will be degraded for some channels and/or a part of the coverage, however no interruption of the dataset acquisition and dissemination is foreseen.",,,,,,1,,,,

"The spectral domain may or may not be contiguous (continuous, with its parts in uninterrupted contact).",0,,,,,,,,,
A spectral band is a subset of the spectral range of an instrument that has associated common properties and is contiguous.,1,,,,,,,,,
For example the IRS has two spectral bands MWIR and LWIR.,0,,,,,,,,,
A spectral channel is the smallest spectral interval measured by an instrument.,0,,,,,,,,,
A spectral band is formed by a set of contiguous spectral channels.,0,,,,,,,,,
For the FCI: A spectral channel is characterised by a set of spectral response functions per spatial sample that comply with the spectral response template for that spectral channel.,1,,,,,,,,,
For the IRS: A spectral channel is defined after spectral resampling of the measured spectral samples to a discrete spectral positions separated according to the spectral channel interval within the spectral band.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The spectral channel, identified by the index k, has an associated spectral variable, ξ k, where this location corresponds to the position of its spectral response function centroid.",1,,,,,,,,,
"A radiance sample is an effective radiance measured by the instrument at a specific spatial and spectral location, see Figure 19.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The radiance sample has spatial properties of spatial location (xi,yj) and shape (point spread function).",0,,,,,,,,,
Together the spatial properties are referred to as the spatial sample or pixel depending on whether the radiance sample has been located on the estimated grid or the reference grid respectively.,1,,,,,,,,,
Likewise the radiance sample has spectral properties of spectral location (ξ k) and shape (spectral response function).,0,,,,,,,,,
Together the spectral properties are referred to as the spectral sample or spectral channel depending on whether the radiance sample is located according to a reference spectral location and spectral response function.,1,,,,,,,,,
The point spread function and spectral response function are related to the instrument response function.,0,,,,,,,,,
The spectral channel is fixed by the optical and detector element spectral filtering characteristics.,1,,,,,,,,,
Thus for each spatial sample of a spectral channel a single radiance sample is measured.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The spatial samples are rectified to the reference grid to form pixels, again each with their associated radiance sample.",0,,,,,,,,,
For the IRS: A spectral sounding is taken at a location given by the spatial sample.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Once the spectral sounding interferogram has been Fourier transformed to the spectral domain a series of spectral samples are obtained, each with its own radiance sample.",1,,,,,,,,,
"For the LI: A single spectral channel is defined, thus each spatial sample has an associated radiance sample.",1,,,,,,,,,
"In the case of the IRS the PSF of the spatial sample will vary with the spectral sample or spectral channel, although the nominal location will be the same across the spectral variable range.",1,,,,,,,,,
For the IRS: Spectral samples are obtained by performing a discrete Fourier Transform of the sampled spectral sounding interferogram for a spatial sample.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The spectral sample, identified by the index k, has an associated spectral variable, ξ k, where this location corresponds to the position of its spectral response function centroid.",1,,,,,,,,,
As the IRS will perform a number of spectral soundings simultaneously there will be a scale change between the spectral spacing of the spectral samples for each spatial sample.,1,,,,,,,,,
This is due to the change in maximum optical path difference caused by the position of a spatial sample in relation to the optical axis.,1,,,,,,,,,
Thus each spatial sample will have spectral samples taken at a set of wavenumbers specific to that spatial sample.,1,,,,,,,,,
The spectral sample surface is defined as the group of spectral samples with the same index number following the discrete Fourier transform of all the spectral sounding interferograms in an area of coverage.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The wavenumbers of the individual spectral samples making up a spectral sample surface is illustrated in Figure 20, In this definition it is assumed that each spectral sounding consists of the same number of interferogram samples.",0,,,,,,,,,
On performing a Fourier transform of the interferogram each spectral sounding has the same number of spectral samples.,1,,,,,,,,,

The spectral width is used to specify the spectral extent of a spectral channel in terms of the normalised spectral response envelope.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The specified spectral width, Δλ0 will be different from the actual spectral width, Δλs, of a spectral channel, where the actual spectral width has traditionally been defined as the Full Width Half Maximum value of the spectral response function, ignoring local oscillations in the passband.",1,,,,,,,,,
"However, with the usage of effective radiance there is strictly speaking no longer a need to provide the actual spectral width, although in practice the spectral width will still be quoted for historical comparison and conceptual understanding reasons.",1,,,,,,,,,
The central wavelength is used to specify the spectral location of a spectral channel in terms of the normalised spectral response envelope.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The specified central wavelength, λ 0, will be different from the actual central wavelength, λ S, of a spectral channel, where the actual central wavelength has traditionally been defined as the centroid of the spectral response function.",1,,,,,,,,,
"However, with the usage of Effective Radiance there is strictly speaking no longer a need to provide the actual central wavelength, although in practice the central wavelength will still be quoted for historical comparison and conceptual understanding reasons.",1,,,,,,,,,
"For the IRS: Spectral calibration is the process of determining the position and shape of the spectral response function (SRF) of a spectral sample or group of spectral samples by the observation of a known, stable spectral scene.",1,,,,,,,,,
"For the IRS: Spectral resampling is the process by which the spectral samples derived from a sampled interferogram are relocated to pre-determined wavenumber locations, thus forming spectral channels.",1,,,,,,,,,
The positions of the spectral channels are those given by the spectral channel interval starting at the first wavenumber in the spectral band.,0,,,,,,,,,

In the definition of IRF the instruments are assumed to be linear.,1,,,,,,,,,

"Synonyms: instrument spectral response function, instrument line shape In the definition of SRF the instruments are assumed to be linear.",0,,,,,,,,,
The spectral response function difference is given for two different conditions.,0,,,,,,,,,
A Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) is an interferometer concept that converts input spectral radiances into interferograms that contain spectral information within the bandpass of the interferometer.,0,,,,,,,,,
A spectral sounding is defined as the complete set of spectral samples for any fixed spatial sample captured during a dwell of a sounder.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Radiant energy is the energy emitted, transferred or received in the form of electromagnetic radiation.",0,,,,,,,,,
"As all the radiometric quantities, irradiance can be integral or spectral.",0,,,,,,,,,
The above definition is applicable to the integral irradiance (with Φ the radiant power over a generic spectral interval).,0,,,,,,,,,
"Radiance is defined as the radiant power per unit projected area and unit solid angle, leaving a surface in a given direction.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The effective radiance is the calibrated output of an instrument with finite spatial and spectral resolution, in units of spectral radiance.",0,,,,,,,,,
It equates to spectral radiance of a spatially and spectrally flat scene that would produce the same output as that produced by the actual scene.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The LI effective radiance is the calibrated output of the LI instrument with finite spatial and temporal resolution, in units of radiance.",0,,,,,,,,,
It is equal to the radiance of a spatially homogeneous scene with a constant output in time that would produce the same output as that produced by the actual scene.,0,,,,,,,,,
The radiometric measurement range is defined as the complete radiometric domain over which the instrument is able to produce calibrated measurements.,0,,,,,,,,,
"For a given spectral value, reflectance is the ratio between the power per unit surface area emitted by a surface and the power per unit surface area (irradiance) incident on the surface.",1,,,,,,,,,
"For a given spectral interval, albedo is the ratio between the power per unit surface area emitted by a surface and the power per unit surface area incident on the surface.",1,,,,,,,,,
"In this definition the measured effective radiance is assumed to contain calibration related errors and radiometric noise contributions, whereas the reference effective radiance is derived using a perfectly characterised reference spectral response function viewing a scene, traceable to a radiometric standards (e.g. National Physical Laboratory (UK)), with zero radiometric noise contribution.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The radiometric noise is the standard deviation of the radiometric error associated with a spectral sample surface or a spectral channel respectively, collected during one repeat cycle.",0,,,,,,,,,
When expressed in this form the radiometric noise is given as noise equivalent delta radiance (NEdL).,1,,,,,,,,,
"For the infrared (IR) spectral channels, the radiometric noise can be given in terms of noise equivalent delta temperature (NEdT) associated with a blackbody temperature at which the NEdT is computed.",1,,,,,,,,,
"For the VIS/NIR spectral channels, the radiometric noise can be given in terms of signal to noise ratio (SNR) associated with a signal at which the SNR is computed.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Radiometric noise applies to radiometrically calibrated spectra, meaning that the noise induced by radiometric calibration is included.",1,,,,,,,,,
The radiometric scaling function is used to derive radiometric requirements for measurement conditions different from the reference case.,1,,,,,,,,,
R(Tm) and R(Tr) are the radiometric requirements for the measured and reference position given by the wavenumber for the IRS.,0,,,,,,,,,
SNRm and SNRr are the signal to noise ratios for the measured and reference conditions conditions respectively.,0,,,,,,,,,
The radiometric resolution is the minimum radiometric quantization step of an instrument.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The radiometric accuracy is the mean radiometric error associated with a spectral sample surface or a spectral channel, collected during a repeat cycle.",0,,,,,,,,,
The above definition deviates from the ISO 5725:1998 usage of the term accuracy.,0,,,,,,,,,
The radiometric stability is the absolute value of the difference between the radiometric accuracy of two different images.,0,,,,,,,,,
For the FCI IR spectral channels the medium term radiometric stability is the radiometric stability between any two images lying in the interval between two calibration cycles.,1,,,,,,,,,
For the FCI VIS/NIR spectral channels the medium term radiometric stability is the radiometric stability evaluated between any two images separated by less than or equal to radiometric stability evaluated between any two sounding LAC’s or FDC’s separated by less than or equal to 24 hours.,1,,,,,,,,,

"The trigger threshold is used, at detector element level to discriminate a lightning optical pulse from the background radiance.",1,,,,,,,,,
The Background Radiance for each LI detector element in the LI detector array averaged over a given time interval.,0,,,,,,,,,
A lightning event is defined as a LI triggered event caused by a lightning optical pulse.,1,,,,,,,,,
The field of view (FOV) is the solid angle subtended by some portion of an instrument.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The term can be applied to a detector element, a detector array, a focal plane containing Usage of the term field of view without a specific reference to the item under consideration is often confusing.",0,,,,,,,,,
A spatial sample is a spatial location in the area of coverage at which an instrument returns a measurement.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The spatial sample is associated with a single radiance sample per spectral sample in the case of a non-resampled spectra, a single radiance sample per spectral channel in the case of a resampled spectra and the mean radiance sample for all spectral samples in the case of an spectral sounding interferogram.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The spatial sample, identified by the indices (i,j), is spatially located at (xi,yj), where this location corresponds to the position of its point spread function centroid.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The Point Spread Function (PSF) is defined as the output signal to input spectral radiant intensity ratio, with the output signal being the effective radiance measured by the instrument when observing a spectrally uniform point source.",0,,,,,,,,,
The PSF is specific to the selected spatial sample or pixel and spectral sample or spectral channel and is a function of the spatial position.,0,,,,,,,,,
Another consequence of the definition is the fact that the integral of PSF along the spatial variables is unity.,1,,,,,,,,,
In the definition of PSF the instruments are assumed to be linear.,1,,,,,,,,,
Image rectification is the process creating a level 1c image from a level 1b image.,0,,,,,,,,,
The level 1c image has the property that there is a well-defined and invariant relationship between image coordinates (rows and columns) and the Earth location (geodetic latitude and longitude).,0,,,,,,,,,
In order to achieve this transformation the radiance samples associated with the level 1b spatial samples are interpolated from the estimated grid to the reference grid to give radiance samples for each level 1c pixel.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Image navigation specifically refers to the knowledge of the relationship between a spatial sample in instrument coordinates and the corresponding point on the earth, given by latitude and longitude coordinates.",0,,,,,,,,,
"In general, image navigation refers to the methods employed to obtain that knowledge, whereas image navigation accuracy is a measure of how well that relationship is known.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Image navigation is used to derive the verification grid of past spatial sample positions, where means to derive this knowledge are available.",1,,,,,,,,,
When used to derive the position of future spatial samples based on past information the estimated grid is generated.,1,,,,,,,,,
Image registration is an indication as to how well image navigation knowledge is maintained and controlled between images separated over time or between different spectral channels or instruments.,1,,,,,,,,,
A pixel is a precise location on the reference grid at which an instrument returns a measurement.,0,,,,,,,,,
The pixel is constructed from a number of spatial samples that have been interpolated to the given reference grid location during the image rectification process.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The pixel, identified by the indices (i,j), is spatially located at (xi,yj).",0,,,,,,,,,
"Like the spatial sample the pixel also possess a point spread function that may extend over a number of SSDs in all directions, i.e. it will not be same as a square of sides SSD in length.",0,,,,,,,,,
The actual site (AS) of a spatial sample corresponds to the centroid of the true projection of the spatial sample point spread function on the Earth’s surface at the time of measurement.,0,,,,,,,,,
The combined actual sites of an image give the actual grid.,0,,,,,,,,,
The measured site (MS) of a spatial sample corresponds to the estimate of the spatial sample actual site as derived from the image navigation process and used in the image rectification process or delivered as IDP auxiliary data with the level 1b data.,1,,,,,,,,,
The combined measured sites of an image give the estimated grid.,0,,,,,,,,,
The reference site (RS) is the geographical location of a pixel and corresponds to one of the grid points of the reference grid.,0,,,,,,,,,
The corrected site (CS) is the true geographical location of the centroid of the PSF associated with a pixel.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Ideally a corrected site corresponding to each pixel is measureable, but in practice only geographic features such as coast lines, mountains and lakes will be available.",1,,,,,,,,,
In practice the location of the geographic features will be to sub-SSD accuracy.,1,,,,,,,,,
Coregistration is used to describe the relative position of the spatial samples or pixels between different spectral channels of an instrument or between instruments.,1,,,,,,,,,
The term can be applied to the spatial or the temporal position of spatial samples or pixels.,0,,,,,,,,,
RSPKE is only given for spectral channels of identical spatial sampling distance.,1,,,,,,,,,
When the RPPKE between spectral channels with differing spatial sampling distance is A group of p2 of the finer resolution spectral channel pixels centred on a coarse resolution pixel is taken as a pixel group.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Each fine resolution pixel group is identified by the indices (i,j) of the coarse resolution pixel.",0,,,,,,,,,
The reference site for the fine resolution pixel group is the mean reference site of the fine resolution pixels.,0,,,,,,,,,
Due to the properties of the reference grid this means that the fine resolution pixel group and coarse resolution pixel are located at the same position.,1,,,,,,,,,
Likewise the corrected site for the fine resolution pixel group is the mean corrected site of the fine resolution pixels.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Eclipse is defined as when the solar disk is occulted by the Earth or Moon, as viewed from the MTG satellite.",1,,,,,,,,,
The eclipse start is the time at which the sun starts to be occulted by the Earth or moon.,1,,,,,,,,,
The maximum depth of an eclipse occurs at the time when the sun centre crosses the plane containing the satellite and Earth (or moon) centre lying perpendicular to the sun’s direction of relative motion in satellite centred reference frame with the x axis pointing to the Earth (or moon) centre.,1,,,,,,,,,
The solar restricted zones are applicable for the uneclipsed and partially eclipsed sun.,1,,,,,,,,,
It is defined to allow graded relaxation of requirements for spatial samples and pixels located close to the sun.,1,,,,,,,,,

"Again (s3) points northwards, and (s1) directs to the centre of the earth.",0,,,,,,,,,
The vector re points from the centre of the earth to a point P on the earth's surface.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Thus, λe is the longitude and φe is the geocentric latitude describing the point P.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Thus pixels at the western side of the Earth have a lower index and a φ is the N-S scanning angle and corresponds to the standard definition of elevation, for an observation from the instrument perspective.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Note that the first row, column of the reference grid is indexed 1,1. x0 and y0 gives the angle from the origin of the projection (the direction s1) to the centre of the pixel in the first row and column of the reference grid.",0,,,,,,,,,
All trigonometric functions assume angles in degree.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The geostationary radius is the distance from the Earth’s centre to the satellite in geostationary orbit and can be calculated from the sum of the geostationary altitude and the equatorial Earth radius, in turn derived from the Earth's reference ellipsoid.",0,,,,,,,,,
The geostationary altitude (35786.4 km) is the distance from the satellite in geostationary orbit to the sub-satellite point.,0,,,,,,,,,
Geographical co-ordinates give a location on earth as determined by geographical longitude (lon) and geographical latitude (lat).,1,,,,,,,,,

Numbering is not necessarily sequential, gaps in the sequence leave room to add additional related requirements when they are discovered.,1,,,,,,,,
This section lists the functional characteristics that the GD CC db must support.,0,,,,,,,,,
"It also identifies what the database does, what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The functional requirements are broken into subsections by general functions, data functions, and interface functions.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The general functional requirements apply to the system as a whole, without respect to specific functions or processes.",0,,,,,,,,,
The data requirements identify and describe the management of information to be acquired and disseminated.,0,,,,,,,,,

"The performance requirements are divided into subsections and are provided in the form of design constraints, quality requirements, and system performance requirements.",0,,,,,,,,,
Design constraints apply existing rules or external conditions to the system.,0,,,,,,,,,
Examples of design constraints are communication standards and requirements for standardised hardware or software.,0,,,,,,,,,
These quality requirements pertain directly to maintaining a high level of service quality.,1,,,,,,,,,
System performance requirements specify quantitatively what the system must do and in what timeframe.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Organisational requirements deal with policies regarding external parties involved with the system, personnel roles, training, and security needs.",0,,,,,,,,,

"In order to enable reusability and commonality across the EAN.UCC Business Message Standards, a common library has been developed to support the technical implementation of the EAN.UCC standards into XML schemas resulting in standardized data types and field sizes.",1,,,,,,,,,
Item is the second message in the trade process following the Party message.,1,,,,,,,,,
Item elements are the mandatory attributes needed to align the item information between trading partners.,0,,,,,,,,,
These attributes in combination ensure the uniqueness of the data set associated with a GTIN.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The use, definition, and relevance of these attributes is the same for ALL EAN.UCC industries.",0,,,,,,,,,
Following the Item attributes is an extension of cross industry.,0,,,,,,,,,
These are data attributes that may be required in conducting commerce between partners for the trade of an item or service.,0,,,,,,,,,
These attributes are relevant to more than one industry.,0,,,,,,,,,
The definition of these attributes must be the same for all industries.,0,,,,,,,,,
Item and the extension of the cross industry data processes include communicating the data elements necessary to support the core business requirements in the global trading environment.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The Party and Item process are mandatory in the completion of the price, purchase order, invoice, etc.",1,,,,,,,,,
The audience of the standards would be any participant in the global supply chain.,0,,,,,,,,,
"This would include retailers, manufacturers, service providers and other third parties.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Change Requests: 01-000009, 01-000010, 01-000064, 01-000065.",0,,,,,,,,,

Acknowledgement is also due to the work going on in the XML environment.,1,,,,,,,,,
The buyer and seller must make contact and set up a business relationship before trade can proceed.,1,,,,,,,,,
This initial contact can be made in many different ways.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Following the establishment of the trading agreement the parties must exchange their basic business data such as trading partner names, addresses, locations, item attributes, price lists, contracts and trading partner agreements.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Specifically, the Core Item message follows the Core Party message in the data alignment process.",0,,,,,,,,,
This process creates a common understanding between the trading parties which can be used as a resource throughout the trading process.,1,,,,,,,,,
"There is only one scenario in the Item data communication process as described in problem statement of section 1.1. communicating the core item and cross industry data elements following the establishment of a business relationship between suppier, buyer or third party.",1,,,,,,,,,
The objective of this document is to elaborate the Data Synchronization Data Model for Trade Item (hereafter referred to as ‘Data Sync Trade Item’) business process in enough detail to support the construction of standards.,1,,,,,,,,,
"It is assumed that the players, both seller and buyer, have established a business understanding of the trading partner relationship.",0,,,,,,,,,
The challenge is to provide the core elements necessary to complete all supply chain processes without duplicates.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The two general players in the Data Sync Trade Item business process are the ""seller"" and the ""buyer"".",0,,,,,,,,,
"Depending on the specific nature of the relationship other players may have a role, such as a Third Party.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The graphic flow below pictures the core sequence of messages, and is expanded to account for additional scenarios.",0,,,,,,,,,
The Data Sync Trade Item business process begins when the parties decide to do business together.,1,,,,,,,,,
The next step is for the buyer to communicate the Party organizational information to the seller.,1,,,,,,,,,
The seller provides his Party organizational information to buyer.,0,,,,,,,,,
Other data alignment follows such as item and price attributes.,0,,,,,,,,,
The start-state of the Data Sync Trade Item business process begins during the initial discussions between the trading partners and the need to exchange item information.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Once the Data Sync Trade Item business message has been accepted by both the seller and buyer, then data alignment has been achieved.",1,,,,,,,,,
This process can be an ongoing process as item business information changes or new parties are added.,1,,,,,,,,,
The process of trading goods and services can now occur.,1,,,,,,,,,
The end-state of the Data Sync Trade Item business process occurs when the parties have achieved Party and Item data alignment.,1,,,,,,,,,
Applies item data or notifies the seller of any errors in the data.,0,,,,,,,,,
See the work completed by the data synchronization project team for a detailed view of data communication.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The Data Sync Trade Item messages include the item’s unique identification, descriptions, and characteristics.",0,,,,,,,,,
"To help with the implementation of this data model, several key definitions are listed below.",1,,,,,,,,,
Master data is considered to be that set of data that describes the specifications and structure of each item and party involved in the supply chain processes.,1,,,,,,,,,
The uniqueness of the data associated with a trade item is given only by the GTIN.,0,,,,,,,,,
"This data is static, not dependent on a transaction.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Transactional data is that set of data that can only be determined during a business transaction, i.e., plan, sell, buy, and deliver cycle.",1,,,,,,,,,
Master Data Alignment is the process of timely distribution of accurate Master Data from one partner to others and the correct use of this data.,0,,,,,,,,,
Such synchronization and use of Master Data leads to more accurate business transactions and therefore reinforces the efficiency of the supply chain operations.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Successful Master Data Alignment is achieved via the use of EAN.UCC coding specifications throughout the supply chain, communication of all changes and new information between trading partners and use of the information exchanged in subsequent transactions.",1,,,,,,,,,

The condition Trading Partner Dependent is applied to any attribute whose value is dependent on a buyer and seller relationship.,1,,,,,,,,,
"An attribute, which has the condition Trading Partner Dependent, can have only one set of values per GLN of Party Receiving Data.",1,,,,,,,,,
These are attributes whose value is dependent on a specific point-to-point agreement between a buyer and a seller.,1,,,,,,,,,
This condition is used to indicate that multiple values can be submitted for a trade item.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Where there is a need to express multiple measures, these are handled through indicating the attribute type as ‘Measurement’.",1,,,,,,,,,

This section includes Best Practices and Examples explaining how to best use this data model.,,0,,,,,,,,
It also includes implementation guides for a variety of the more complicated issues encountered when designing the standards outlined by this document.,,0,,,,,,,,
It also provides an overal review of the basic precepts used when developing this data model.,,0,,,,,,,,
This model was designed with the intent of providing all industries with a generic template with which to build their own data model.,,0,,,,,,,,
EAN.UCC currently has identified 23 different industries which participate in its standards development and application processes.,,0,,,,,,,,
"While it is recognized that each industry has different needs, this model attempts to provide a flexible data model framework, which covers what is common accross industries and upon which these industries can append their own unique needs.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The data model assumes a base level of business transactions and agreements between buyer and seller, which then lead to an exchange of information deemed to be necessary for conducting normal business transactions.",,0,,,,,,,,
This set of information is herein called a data dictionary.,,0,,,,,,,,
Core – these attributes are absolutely necessary to facilitate the accurate sharing of data sets between parties of all industries.,,1,,,,,,,,
The combination of these five attributes guarantees the uniqueness of that data set.,,0,,,,,,,,
The definition and use of these attributes is common to all industries.,,0,,,,,,,,
"In this data model, the five core attributes are: GTIN of the trade item, the GLN of the information provider, the target market in which this data set is valid, a EAN.UCC external classification value, and a system generated Product identification as a process is mandatory.",,1,,,,,,,,
Extension – these attributes are shared among several industries.,,0,,,,,,,,
The determination of whether these attributes are mandatory or optional is made based on the business need of each industry.,,0,,,,,,,,
It is important to share the responsibility for maintenance of these attributes and to maintain a common definition across industries since the buyer receiving data may receive it from multiple industries.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Where industries use an attribute in different ways, a new attribute must be developed.",,1,,,,,,,,
Industry specific extension – these attributes are such that they are only relevant to one industry.,,0,,,,,,,,
The definition of these values is determined by this industry.,,0,,,,,,,,
The complete data model for an industry is made up of a combination of these three types of attributes.,,0,,,,,,,,
"It is expected that attributes may be added or deleted from the model in the future.Also, as more industries become involved in the EAN.UCC GSMP process, it is expected that more industry specific extensions will be created.",,0,,,,,,,,
"In most cases, the agreement reached by the two parties that will be communicating data will include only a portion of the data model.",,0,,,,,,,,
This is because this model is designed to capture all possible business needs of the industry.,,1,,,,,,,,
"In many cases, the buyer will only require a subset of these attributes in order to conduct business in the manner that they are accustomed.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The entire set of data attributes assigned to a GTIN may vary depending on who provides the information, and in which target market the data is relevant.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Within the global data synchronization environment, the combination of three key attributes, GLN of information provider, GTIN of the trade item, and the Target Market identifies a unique set of values for the trade items’ attributes.",,1,,,,,,,,
This combination can also affect which attributes are communicated.,,0,,,,,,,,
The values of attributes can vary for a GTIN when GLN of information provider or Target market are changed.,,0,,,,,,,,
Example – “orderingLeadTime” may vary depending on target market.,,0,,,,,,,,
All variation must be compliant with GTIN allocation rules per the General EAN.UCC Specifications.,,0,,,,,,,,
Variations that do not comply will require a new GTIN.,,0,,,,,,,,
"As stated above, in addition possible variations in values for the same attribute, the list of attributes communicated may change based on these three keys.",,,1,,,,,,,
Changes in the information provider can change the list of attributes associated with a GTIN.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Example – Information provider A chooses to provide values for 50 attributes for a GTIN, while information provider B chooses to provide values for 100, seeing this as a competitive advantage.",,,0,,,,,,,
The relevant target market can also affect the selection of attributes.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Certain target markets will have legal requirements for some attributes, while other target markets will not.",,,0,,,,,,,
Example – “dangerous goods” attributes are currently required in certain countries.,,,0,,,,,,,
Parties that do not operate in these countries will not be required to communicate these attributes to their customers.,,,1,,,,,,,
"There has been a long running debate within the EAN.UCC item project team regarding the application of a principle which states that if information about a product hierarchy is to be communicated, it is required that a GTIN be allotted to that level and the information only be attached to that GTIN.",,,1,,,,,,,
"At the time this document was being finalized, this debate was still taking place.",,,1,,,,,,,
It is the intent of the Item group to present to the Align Data BRG a paper describing the current industry practices as they relate to hierarchy with the proper industry endorsement and representation .,,,0,,,,,,,
This model is designed in conjunction with a widely accepted view of product containment hierarchy found in the commercial products industries.,,,0,,,,,,,
Eight discreet “levels” of GTIN Hierarchy have been identified.,,,0,,,,,,,
Implementation with any level of automation will require the programs to map discreetly from each of these GTIN hierarchy layers.,,,0,,,,,,,
Each attribute has the potential for a different meaning depending on which layer it’s attached to.,,,0,,,,,,,
Each attribute may also vary in cardinality or condition depending on the ‘product type name’ of the GTIN.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The following guidelines have been created, debated, practiced, reviewed, and endorsed by the UCCnet community over the last 3 years.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The Guidelines Task Group, represented by over 60 individuals and participating companies has endorsed these Guidelines.",,,0,,,,,,,
"May have children (DS, CA, PK, EA) in multiple instances.",,,0,,,,,,,
"May have children (DS, CA, PK, EA) in a single instance.",,,0,,,,,,,
May have (CA or EA) children in multiple instances.,,,0,,,,,,,
May contain children (PK or EA) in a single instance.,,,0,,,,,,,
Orderable: True or False / Consumable: True or False.,,,0,,,,,,,
This may be a consumable innerpack (i.e. Carton of Cigarettes) or it may be simply a logistical pack (i.e. Dozens of toothbrushes).,,,0,,,,,,,
Multiple instances of (DS or CA) parents are allowed.,,,0,,,,,,,
Orderable: true or False / ConsumerUnit: True or False.,,,0,,,,,,,
The lowest level of the item hierarchy intended or labeled for individual retail sale.,,,0,,,,,,,
"May have multiple instances of (PK, CA, DS, PL, or MX) parents.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In addition, a separate, unique GTIN is assigned to each orderable prepack.",,,0,,,,,,,
This GTIN is not scanned by the retailer at the Point-of-Sale.,,,0,,,,,,,
"For example, the NRF size code for the orderable reserved for prepacks and setpacks.",,,0,,,,,,,
"A valid NRF color code will be assigned to the GTIN when all trade items are of the same color in the prepack; otherwise, the NRF color code 999- assorted prepacks whether the prepack is assorted by size only, color only, or both size and color.",,,1,,,,,,,
Different prepacks of trade items are quantity contents of the prepacks are different.,,,0,,,,,,,
The individual trade item GTIN must be scannable at the Point-of-Sale and may or may not be orderable separately outside the setpack(s).,,,0,,,,,,,
"For example, the NRF size code for the orderable setpack GTIN will be assigned in the 90001-91999 range, reserved for prepacks and setpacks.",,,0,,,,,,,
"A valid NRF color code will be assigned to the setpack GTIN when all trade items are of the same color in the setpack, otherwise the NRF color code 999-assorted is assigned.",,,1,,,,,,,
Different setpacks are assigned different GTINs when either the trade item or quantity contents are different.,,,1,,,,,,,
A multipack is not intended to be broken apart and sold as individual trade items.,,,0,,,,,,,
A multipack is assigned a GTIN that is different from the GTIN that may be assigned to the individual trade items.,,,0,,,,,,,
Generally components of a multipack are not marked with individual trade item GTINs.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Each different multipack of the same trade items (e.g., three-pack socks versus six-pack socks) must have a different GTIN assigned.",,,0,,,,,,,
Each different multipack GTIN must also have its own trade item/color ID/size ID.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The hierarchy levels Pre-pack/Assortment and Multipack are not included in the next table, as the discussions of hierarchy were not finalized.",,,0,,,,,,,
Attributes in the data model are designed such that they can and are used to describe the same value for any product hierarchy level.,,,0,,,,,,,
The next page shows a table which lists all the attributes contained in this data model and s at which product hierarchy level they are relevant.,,,0,,,,,,,
Refer to Class Diagram for Trade Item in the UML section where item hierarchy is handled.,,,0,,,,,,,
Item containment provides a method of identifying the contents of a GTIN that is a packaging hierarchy rather than a consumer unit.,,,0,,,,,,,
This can occur multiple times depending upon the number of levels in the hierarchy.,,,0,,,,,,,
All components of each potential level of packaging must already be defined in order to be used in Item Containment.,,,1,,,,,,,
Each level has to be identified with a product identifier and each level defines the containment (GTIN) of the next level.,,,0,,,,,,,
It is recommended that only GTINs be used in Item containment.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The attribute structure for classification included in this document reflects the learnings from the work that the GCI Product Classification workgroup is conducting at this point in time and applies to the Food, Beverage and Tobacco (grocery) sector.",,,0,,,,,,,
Potential modifications to the codification structure may result in the inclusion in the Data Sync Trade Item model of additional attributes coming from other industry sectors (e.g. General Merchandise).,,,0,,,,,,,
These potential modifications will be considered after the EAN.UCC's final agreement on a global classification schema is announced.,,,1,,,,,,,
These products have been treated or packaged in such a way as to extend their consumable life.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Includes products that may be described as Nectar, Fruit Drink or Juice Drink and available in single flavors such as carrot, tomato, orange, apple etc or they may be blends of more than one such as orange & apricot, cranberry & raspberry etc.",,,0,,,,,,,
B.: Only one possible attribute value per attribute type.,,,0,,,,,,,
Change Request (CR) 02-000102 was submitted to the EAN.UCC GSMP process and relates to how to measure the physical dimension of a product.,,,0,,,,,,,
"At the July 10, 2002 conference call of the Align BRG, this Change Request was reviewed and the BRG agreed to forward to the Physical Technical Requirements Group (PTRG) for the definition of the physical requirements.",,,0,,,,,,,
"This work is being developed by a subgroup of PTRG and will go through ballot cycles, which are estimated to conclude sometime in the first quarter of impact of the output on the Item work.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Product orientation principles developed by the PTRG will affect the following attributes: width, depth, and height.",,,0,,,,,,,
EAN.UCC currently has the following classes related to Language.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Description Class: it contains two attributes, one is language and the other is text.",,,0,,,,,,,
Text Description Class: it contains one or more Description Classes.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Long Description Class: it contains two attributes, one is language and the other is long text.",,,0,,,,,,,

It allows for multiple combinations of language and longtext.,,,0,,,,,,,
These classes allow users to fill in the language and the text.,,,0,,,,,,,
The language for the text is identified using a two character code from the ISO 639 language code list.,,,0,,,,,,,
EAN.UCC currently has two classes related to Monetary Amount.,,,0,,,,,,,
Monetary Amount allows for multiple currencies and value or Amount.,,,0,,,,,,,
These classes allow users to fill in the currency ISO Code and the value.,,,0,,,,,,,
The currency for the value is identified using a code from the ISO4217 currency code list.,,,0,,,,,,,
The following describes how unit of measure is handled in the data model.,,,0,,,,,,,
EAN.UCC currently has two classes related to measurement.,,,0,,,,,,,
One is 'Measurement class' and the other is 'Measurement Value'.,,,0,,,,,,,
Measurement allows for multiple Measurement Values.,,,0,,,,,,,
Measurement Value allows for one Measurement Value.,,,0,,,,,,,
These classes allow the users to fill in the unit of measure and the float (allows decimal value).,,,0,,,,,,,
Example: 100 degree Fahrenheit or 38 degree Celsius.,,,0,,,,,,,
There was no need to create another attribute for unit of measure because it is fulfilled by the use of the Measurement class because the Measurement class is reused.,,,1,,,,,,,
There is multiple and numerous possible unit of measures.,,,0,,,,,,,
The EAN.UCC system refers to the UN/Cefact #20 list for the possible unit of measure.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The unit of measure is not broken down into categories of UOM such as ""time UOM, Weight UOM, dimensional UOM, or net content UOM.",,,0,,,,,,,
Product Description is one of the four attributes designated as being mandatory (within the Global Data Synchronization process) for uniquely identifying a set of data associated with a GTIN.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The product description field which is considered core, “tradeItemDescription“ is automatically generated by the model from the four attributes listed below.",,,0,,,,,,,
"If an attribute is left blank or not defined, the product description exists only of attributes populated.",,,1,,,,,,,
"While two of the four attributes are designated as optional, since they may or may not exist, it is widely recognized that most information providers will seek to provide values for all of these attributes so as to provide a product description that is as accurate as possible.",,,0,,,,,,,
The Product Description attributes replaces the Item Description Long and Medium found in the previous GCI model.,,,0,,,,,,,
"For more accurate product description, several new attributes have been added to the model.",,,1,,,,,,,
Fields were included with the recognition that the great majority of categories have not yet had classification schemas deployed at the time of this document’s publication.,,,0,,,,,,,
This section presents the issues concerning code lists that users have identified in implementing the current EAN(cid:121)UCC Trade Item Data Synchronization Standards.,,,0,,,,,,,
It would be better for all communities to adopt one set of code lists now.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The analysis that resulted in these code list recommendations took into account all definitions, examples, and business rules contained in the Trade Item BRD.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Code lists from EANCOM, UNCEFACT, ISO, ANSI X12, VICS EDI, and UCS/WINS were also examined.",,,0,,,,,,,
The goal was to develop code lists that reflected the intent of the original developers of the Trade Item.,,,0,,,,,,,
It is envisioned these code list will be added to as new requirements are introduced.,,,1,,,,,,,
It is not an exclusive or all-inclusive list but this is a living list.,,,0,,,,,,,
There are several code lists used within the EANUCC system that are maintained by agencies other than EANUCC.,,,0,,,,,,,
The code lists that are reference in this section apply to several attributes within the trade item as well as other business message standards.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The following ISO codes lists are used to represent languages (for text attributes), Country and Subdivision (for country of origin and target market), and currencies (for amounts), and the source for the code list.",,,0,,,,,,,
See Code List Source Bibliography section of this document.,,,0,,,,,,,
Maintain a code list based on an external code list.,,,0,,,,,,,
Any code list EANUCC maintains will need to be accessible to the community and maintained in such a way as to be detached from the schema versioning.,,,0,,,,,,,
The end result is the code lists will be managed outside of the schemas in such a way to remain easy to update and allow for the syntax checking of code values as is done with enumerated lists.,,,0,,,,,,,
The Unit of Measure (UOM) code is used throughout the EANUCC System.,,,0,,,,,,,
In order to provide the best value to the EANUCC community the UOM code list will be maintained by EANUCC for its community.,,,1,,,,,,,
It is anticipated additional code values will be required.,,,0,,,,,,,
When the business requirements are defined additional code values can be added.,,,1,,,,,,,
The table below lists all of the attributes whose values are contained in code lists.,,,0,,,,,,,
The Item team created a subgroup to handle the code lists.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The subgroup’s objective was to keep the lists as short as possible, removing inconsistent, repeated, unclear or too generic values and also removing information handled through other data elements (E.g., Hazardous related information is handled by specific Des).",,,0,,,,,,,
The issue of governance and maintenance of these code lists is still being developed.,,,0,,,,,,,
Several of the code lists are maintained by outside agencies such as ISO.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Other code lists are unique to this data model, and will need to be maintained by an EAN.UCC entity.",,,0,,,,,,,
The table enclosed in the following page represents the work of the group at the time this document was released for Align BRG’s approval.,,,0,,,,,,,
A separate and more complete Addendum may need to be added at a later time.,,,0,,,,,,,
The Data Sync Trade Item model was built keeping in mind the design of the data synchronization process being developed by the Data Sync Project Team under the Align Data BRG.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The key principle that is carried over from that work is the assumption that when a trade item’s information is transmitted from an information provider to a data pool, and data pool to data pool (in network data synchronization) that the entire product hiearchy is transmitted.",,,1,,,,,,,
"In the grocery industry, that product hiearchy will normally include item, case and pallet, and may also include other levels.",,,0,,,,,,,
A message detailing information about a trade item must include at least one consumable and one orderable unit.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Included in this product hiearchy, it is understood that each link connecting the various levels is also considered to be a part of the message.",,,0,,,,,,,
The following four Appendixes were incorporated for informational purposes.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Shows how do attributes vary (by Target Market, by Relationship) or how can attributes be repeated (Multiple Values Allowed).",,,0,,,,,,,
APPENDIX B – Attribute Association by Trade Item Hierarchy Level for Data Sync Synchronization.,,,0,,,,,,,
It is recognized that the attributes listed in this data model may be used for a ‘one-to-many’ global data synchronization process.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In light of this use, the table in Appendix 3 lists which attributes are mandatory within this process.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Please , this does not mean that only mandatory attributes are communicated via data sync.",,,0,,,,,,,
"All other attributes, marked as optional here, can also be included in messages.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Based on the Trade Item Implementation feedback presentation on July 7, 2004, the following modifications will be made to the Trade Item.",,,1,,,,,,,
These four attributes are in the Trade Item appendix 1 class diagram.,,,0,,,,,,,
Conversion of Mandatory Boolean attributes into code list solution.,,,0,,,,,,,
The Boolean attribute should be replaced by a code list.,,,0,,,,,,,
Below is the current model for the FMCGTradeItemMarking class and revised solution.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The Florida Courts Technology Commission (“FCTC”), upon motion of its Trial Court Integrated Management Solution (“TIMS”) Committee, adopts this Functional Requirements Document (‘FRD’) to provide specifications for Court Application Processing Systems (“CAPS”) to coordinate the use of information technology and electronic case files, in court and in chambers, by trial court judges and staff.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In addition to the functional requirements set forth in this document, systems must comply with applicable Rules of Judicial Administration, and other technical and functional standards established by the Court that may apply to CAPS.",,,0,,,,,,,
"CAPS in this section must be certified under section 2 below before being deployed, renewed, or substantially modified.",,,0,,,,,,,
Each circuit determines which certified system best meets its needs.,,,0,,,,,,,
The chief judge’s approval shall be required prior to the purchasing or upgrading of any system.,,,1,,,,,,,
Systems built and maintained by clerks of court and limited to their historical functions are excluded from this definition.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Specifically, general purpose files, indexes, or document viewers made available by the clerk to users other than the judiciary and in-court participants are not subject to the functional requirements of this document, although they remain subject to all other FCTC policies and requirements, including but not limited to the Integration and Operability standards and all other requirements set forth by the Supreme Court.",,,0,,,,,,,
This standard does require the clerks of court to make their official court files available to the CAPS in read-only fashion in real time or from a replication delayed no more than five minutes from real time.,,,0,,,,,,,
The CAPS shall accept and display case information from the clerk’s case maintenance system (“CMS”) in form and function consistent with these functional requirements.,,,0,,,,,,,
The system’s design must provide redundancy to eliminate a single point of hardware failure from interrupting CAPS availability to the Court users.,,,0,,,,,,,
"It must use, to the extent feasible, industry standard document formats and transmission protocols, and avoid all use of proprietary formats, data structures, or protocols.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In particular, the additional data elements for specific divisions of court as adopted by the FCTC.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The system must be usable by judges, and also by judicial assistants, clerks, and case managers as the judge may direct.",,,0,,,,,,,
"It must be able to retrieve basic case information, any scheduling or calendaring information the clerk may maintain, the clerk’s progress docket, and the set of electronic documents that constitute the official court file.",,,0,,,,,,,
"When a document is being displayed, the court shall have the option to print one or more pages at once.",,,1,,,,,,,
"It must be designed to minimize risk of data loss, including but not limited to secure, regular, and redundant data backup.",,,0,,,,,,,
It must permit the court to specify the capacity of any multiple case docket and displays must be able to show the portion of capacity remaining.,,,0,,,,,,,
It must also prevent booking a multiple case docket in excess of its capacity unless the user deliberately overrides the capacity.,,,0,,,,,,,
It must also be able to call up a list of cases based on defined criteria and schedule or reschedule all of the cases simultaneously into a new time block.,,,0,,,,,,,
The displayable fields shall be at least: hearing type, case attorneys, location (court and hearing rooms) and case age.,,,0,,,,,
There shall also be a control that opens the progress docket (§5.5).,,,0,,,,,,,
"Basic case information includes division of court); type of case; date opened; current status; identities, roles, and contact information of parties and attorneys.",,,0,,,,,,,
It is the most common entry point for display of the contents of the court file.,,,0,,,,,,,
The court application must display the docket sequence number for each docket entry in the progress docket.,,,0,,,,,,,
It must contain a direct means for accessing legal research providers including but not limited to Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis.,,,0,,,,,,,
The CAPS shall permit editing of the proposed order and file the signed order in PDF/A format.,,,0,,,,,,,
Neither the court nor any county may be prevented from building or customizing their own form banks.,,,0,,,,,,,
"This document has been prepared at the request of Mark Stobbs and is a statement of business and functional requirements for a replacement of the existing ‘Section 29 Database’, which is used to support the Professional Standard Authority’s (PSA) processes related to the review of fitness to practice decisions made by the nine health regulators.",,,0,,,,,,,
"It is envisaged the system will replace the current SharePoint-based system, for which support ends in July 2019.",,,0,,,,,,,
Help the PSA determine the most appropriate route forward.,,,0,,,,,,,
Provide the foundation for the selection of an appropriate technology and vendor.,,,0,,,,,,,
Provide the basis for the selected vendor to make a firm pricing proposal.,,,0,,,,,,,
Reduce the risk of unforeseen additional requirements extending the development phase.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Provide the platform for a rapid, high quality implementation of the system.",,,0,,,,,,,
These requirements have been built on information gathered through interviews conducted in January and February 2018.,,,0,,,,,,,
The PSA currently use a system that’s been developed in SharePoint 2010 to support its work in relation to scrutinising the fitness to practice decisions of the nine health regulators.,,,0,,,,,,,
The PSA plan to replace the system well in advance of support expiring next year.,,,0,,,,,,,
The principle users of the current system are the Scrutiny and Quality team.,,,0,,,,,,,
"While the current system meets the team’s needs, there is scope to further streamline and automate the PSA’s processes.",,,0,,,,,,,
The new system will replace the current SharePoint-based system and the data held there will be migrated across to the new platform.,,,1,,,,,,,
It is envisaged that the new system will replace a number of the data sources and tools that are currently also used to support the Scrutiny and Quality Team’s processes.,,,0,,,,,,,
It isn’t currently anticipated data will be migrated from these four sources.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The system that was used prior to the implementation of the current S29 database is still used to provide staff with access to old cases, as the data wasn’t migrated to the current system.",,,0,,,,,,,
"It is envisaged that this data will also be migrated to the new system, and that this legacy system will be decommissioned in due course.",,,0,,,,,,,
The core system will be used by around 15 internal staff.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The PSA has an office in London, but staff will need to access the system from home and when travelling.",,,0,,,,,,,
"In addition, around 5 external researchers will need controlled access to the system.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Regulators will be able to upload documents to the system via a portal, and legal firms will also be able to access specified cases and documents through a portal.",,,0,,,,,,,
The following section describe how processes are currently supported by the system and how it’s envisaged that the new database will support them moving forward.,,,0,,,,,,,
The final design of the system will be based on the capabilities of the selected technology.,,,0,,,,,,,
All fitness to practice decisions are communicated to the PSA by the health regulator that undertook them.,,,0,,,,,,,
The decision is added to the system as a case for review by the team.,,,0,,,,,,,
The decision is also added to a spreadsheet which is used to report on the cases received.,,,0,,,,,,,
Cases where the maximum available sentence has been imposed by the regulator are closed by the administrator.,,,1,,,,,,,
The initial review is appended as a document to the case.,,,0,,,,,,,
"At the end of the review the team member may recommend no further action is taken, identify a potential learning point that should be fed back to the regulator, request further information, or request a second opinion by a director.",,,1,,,,,,,
A sample of cases that are closed at this stage are reviewed by a director.,,,0,,,,,,,
"To facilitate this review, each week the administrator exports data from the system into an Access database from which a report is run detailing cases that should be considered for review.",,,0,,,,,,,
"If further information is requested from a regulator, the regulator uploads the documents into a portal.",,,1,,,,,,,
The tracking of requests for further information is currently managed in the cases spreadsheet.,,,0,,,,,,,

The system will calculate and update the number of working days available to appeal.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The administrator moves the case to the ‘Initial determination review’ stage, and adds comment to say the harshest sanction has already been imposed.",,,0,,,,,,,
The case is moved to the ‘Case closed’ stage.Cases for review are split into two lists based on their outcome.,,,0,,,,,,,
The list one cases are available to the team coordinators and senior scrutiny officer as a view in the system.,,,0,,,,,,,
The list two cases are passed to the senior solicitors for review on an Excel spreadsheet that’s created by the administrator each week.,,,0,,,,,,,
They set the stage as ‘initial determination review’.,,,0,,,,,,,

This entity tracks information about the FTP cases that the PSA is This entity tracks information about learning points that are This entity tracks information about procedural issues that are This entity tracks financial data related to a case populated from This entity will track the activities related to a case.,,,0,,,,,,,
The following section describes the key entities and the information they will track.,,,0,,,,,,,
The fields described are not intended to be definitive and it is envisaged these will be finalised as part of the design process.,,,0,,,,,,,
The contact entity will track information about current and former registrants.,,,0,,,,,,,
The system will track information about the FTP cases the PSA reviews.,,,0,,,,,,,
"From a case record it will be possible to see associated learning point, procedural issue, invoice, and activity records, including tasks, emails, phone calls and meetings.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Where a case is a review of an existing case, it should be possible to create the review case from the parent substantive case.",,,1,,,,,,,
"There will be a link between the two records, so it should be possible to see the associated parent case from the review case, and any review cases from the parent case.",,,0,,,,,,,
"When a review case is created from the parent case the following fields should be automatically populated based on the values in the parent case: Regulator, Type of Hearing, Registrant Name, Gender, Registrant Number, Practitioner Type, and Charge Summary.",,,1,,,,,,,
It will be possible to easily link a case to another case or another contact record and specify the relationship type.,,,0,,,,,,,
"For example, link two cases that are for the same or similar issues but have been raised by different regulators.",,,0,,,,,,,
It should also be possible to unlink cases if required.,,,0,,,,,,,
It should be possible to attach a document to a case.,,,0,,,,,,,
Documents may be a range of different types including PDF’s and Word documents.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Ideally it should be possible to ‘preview’ a document without opening it, and mark a file as read.",,,0,,,,,,,
"When a case is added, the deadline date for the PSA to appeal a decision should be automatically populated.",,,1,,,,,,,
"This is currently 67 working days if the registrant has the right to appeal the sanction, and deadline will be managed within the system’s settings and will be held against the sanction outcome for each regulator.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The settings of the system should track public holidays, so that these are not included in the working day computation.",,,1,,,,,,,
The final day should no fall on a weekend or public holiday.,,,0,,,,,,,
The Time Remaining field should be updated by the system daily so that users are aware how close the deadline is for appealing a case.,,,1,,,,,,,
The values in the Practitioner Type field will be limited to those that are related to the selected value in the Regulator field.,,,0,,,,,,,
"For example, limited to ‘Doctor’ if the GMC was selected as the regulator.",,,1,,,,,,,
Within the settings of the system it should be possible to specify for any given stage on a case which options are available to the user when they change the stage value.,,,1,,,,,,,
"It should be possible to stop a user moving from one stage to another if defined fields haven’t been filled out, or specific documents uploaded.",,,1,,,,,,,
It should be possible to easily specify and save multiple ‘views’ of case data.,,,0,,,,,,,
"For example, all cases that at a Stage of ‘further information requested’, or all cases where I undertook the original case review which have gone to appeal.",,,0,,,,,,,
"It should be possible to update multiple case records at the same time, for example update the Stage field.",,,0,,,,,,,
The system should track an audit trail of changes to a case record including original values and who made any changes.,,,0,,,,,,,
The system should track an audit trail of any comments added and documents uploaded or deleted.,,,0,,,,,,,
The system should generate a report of the number of cases that need a random second check for each sanction type.,,,0,,,,,,,
The report should ideally randomly select the cases to be reviewed by the director.,,,0,,,,,,,
Either 10% or 20% of cases need to be checked based the type of sanction.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In order to make the number of fields on the case entity manageable, the system should ideally allow unused sections of data to be hidden on the entity form if they aren’t populated.",,,1,,,,,,,
A ‘Total Invoiced to date’ field will be automatically calculated based on the total invoice value of associated invoice records for a case.,,,0,,,,,,,
"It should not be possible to save a case with a ‘Stage’ field value of ‘Send learning point’, if there is no learning point linked to the case.",,,1,,,,,,,
The learning point entity will track information about learning points identified during a case review.,,,0,,,,,,,
The procedural issue entity will track information about procedural issues identified during a case review.,,,0,,,,,,,
It is envisaged that the system will track invoices relating to a case.,,,0,,,,,,,
This data will be primarily populated through a one-way integration with the PSA’s financial software which is currently Sage Line 50.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The system will track activities such as emails, phone conversations, and meetings.",,,0,,,,,,,
The system will allow the definition and assignment of activities.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The activity types will include emails, meetings, phone calls, and to-do’s.",,,0,,,,,,,
These activities may be scheduled for specific times and dates.,,,0,,,,,,,
There should be the option to assign alarms and alerts to highlight important activities.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Assigned activities should be visible against case and contact records, as well as in a list view, and in a diary view.",,,0,,,,,,,
It should be possible to filter the list view for a specific date range.,,,0,,,,,,,
Open and closed activities for all cases should be rolled up and visible at the contact record level.,,,0,,,,,,,
It should be possible to apply filters to open and closed activities to help find the required information.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Filters should include by activity type, date range, and user.",,,0,,,,,,,
Incoming emails and attachments may be stored against a case.,,,0,,,,,,,
"It should be possible for scheduled activities, such as a case meeting, within the CRM system to be synchronised with the Outlook diary.",,,1,,,,,,,
It should be possible for activities scheduled in the Outlook diary to be synchronised with the diary within the CRM system.,,,1,,,,,,,
"It should be possible for a change made to an activity in Outlook to be synchronized with the CRM diary, and a change to an activity within the CRM system to be synchronized with Outlook.",,,1,,,,,,,
When the Stage field on a case is set to ‘Further information requested’ an email will be automatically sent to the relevant regulator requesting they upload the case transcripts into a portal.,,,1,,,,,,,
"When the regulator accesses the portal, they will be presented with the cases where they have been requested to provide further information, but where that upload has yet to be completed.",,,1,,,,,,,
Two folders will be available for the regulator to upload transcripts and exhibits.,,,0,,,,,,,
"A regulator will only see their own cases, and not the cases of other regulators.",,,0,,,,,,,
"The regulator should be able to upload multiple documents to the folder at the same time, and there should be no restrictions on the type or size of the file (users are currently limited to 29mb).",,,0,,,,,,,
The regulator should be able to see and open the files they have uploaded.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The regulator should be able to delete files if, for example, they have uploaded a file by mistake.",,,0,,,,,,,
The regulator should ideally be able to see a status bar to guide them on the progress of uploads.,,,0,,,,,,,
The PSA administrator should receive an automated email notification when files have been uploaded to the portal.,,,1,,,,,,,
Files uploaded to the portal will automatically be appended to the relevant case record.,,,0,,,,,,,
Once the PSA administrator indicates all documents have been received by changing the stage to ‘All information received’ the case folder will no longer be visible to the regulator.,,,1,,,,,,,
"When the PSA decide that they wish to share a case and its related documents with an external legal firm, they will be able to opt to share a case and all details of the case and associated documents will become visible to the designated lawyer when they log into the portal.",,,1,,,,,,,
The PSA will be able to ‘unshare’ a case at which point it will no longer be visible to the legal firm.,,,1,,,,,,,
The legal firm should be able to download appended documents to cases shared with them.,,,0,,,,,,,
"They should also be able to upload documents within the portal and these will, in turn, be appended to the case.",,,0,,,,,,,
There should be a simple means to search on key fields such as contact name and email address.,,,0,,,,,,,
These simple search criteria should include ‘starting with’ and ‘contains’ searches.,,,0,,,,,,,
It should be possible to make all fields searchable.,,,0,,,,,,,
"It should be possible to perform key word searches, to bring back records that contain identified key words.",,,0,,,,,,,
It should be possible to search for documents in the system.,,,0,,,,,,,
Ideally a key word search would be able to identify documents that contain defined search terms within the document.,,,0,,,,,,,
The system should facilitate complex searches which allow the combination of any field within the database including those that have been added through configuration or customization of the system.,,,0,,,,,,,

"This section introduces the guideline document and describes its purpose, the scope, the environment and the conditions.",,,0,,,,,,,
This section describes the general background why ACRIS started this initiative and the global context.,,,0,,,,,,,
This section explains the use cases defined in the project’s scope.,,,0,,,,,,,
This section describes the logic of the data model that is used throughout the project.,,,0,,,,,,,
"ACRIS is an acronym for “Aviation Community Recommended Information Services”, and is one of the working groups under ACI World.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Members of the working group are airports, airlines and vendors.",,,0,,,,,,,
The purpose of this working group is to define standard data models and web interfaces for exchanging operational and passenger related data between the partners in a standardized way.,,,0,,,,,,,
Two working group face-to-face meetings are being held each year and additional meetings or conference calls are scheduled as required by the projects and topics.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The working group is open for airports, airlines and partners from the aviation industry; participation is on voluntary base.",,,0,,,,,,,
All contribution on meetings or projects is done on the own expense of the participants.,,,0,,,,,,,
For more information on ACI ACRIS working group visit the homepage (http://groups.aci.aero/home) or have a look at the ACI ACRIS information video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fj7xcAauCSo).,,,0,,,,,,,
Further details on ACI World can be found at http://www.aci.aero/.,,,0,,,,,,,
The ACRIS Semantic Model is a collection of knowledge-driven models organized to support meaningful communication for business collaboration.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The following chapters are giving a brief overview on the ACRIS Semantic Model, for more information see http://groups.aci.aero/home.",,,0,,,,,,,
"As the participation on ACI ACRIS projects is on a voluntary base, some airlines, airports and partners were working in the project continuously, others supported the project in different phases according to their capacity or special knowledge.",,,0,,,,,,,
As many players in the aviation industry are interested in efficient and high quality services for their customers – including passengers – it make sense to define common standards for information exchange and data models.,,,0,,,,,,,
There are well known organizations for the different areas within the aviation industry representing their members but it is also important to think outside the box.,,,0,,,,,,,
IATA has started the “Simplify the Business” (STB) initiative which shares under the roof of the “Travel Communication” project a lot of the goals with ACRIS Seamless Travel.,,,0,,,,,,,
IATA participated in the ACRIS Seamless Travel project from the beginning and the aim is to create an industry wide common standard that is approved and actively used by airport as well as airline representatives.,,,0,,,,,,,
"This document is designed for business people and decision makers of airports, airlines, aviation related vendors and service providers to understand the background, meaning and powerful possibilities of the ACI ACRIS Seamless Travel data model and Web services.",,,0,,,,,,,
Data interchange in the aviation industry is a big challenge and strategic factor.,,,0,,,,,,,
"And that not only means to exchange some data, but to ensure that there is a common understanding of the content, independently which data is exchanged and how many partners are using that content.",,,0,,,,,,,
How do the ACI ACRIS Seamless Travel data model and web services fit to these objectives?,,,0,,,,,,,
Why should this standard be chosen over implementing proprietary interfaces for your Open Data initiative?,,,0,,,,,,,
"Many aviation related companies use the term “Seamless Travel” and of course, there are many different meanings of this term.",,,0,,,,,,,
The purpose of this chapter is to explain why Seamless Travel is a topic for ACI ACRIS and what exactly the meaning of Seamless Travel in this context is.,,,0,,,,,,,
The Seamless Travel topic was introduced to the ACI ACRIS working group in 2013 by Munich Airport.,,,0,,,,,,,
The idea behind it is to provide passengers as well as visitors with all relevant information and give them the possibility to book services of companies from the whole aviation industry ecosystem.,,,0,,,,,,,
"This includes not only airlines and airports, but also ground transportation providers and commercial tenants.",,,0,,,,,,,
"One of the industry observations, namely that people don’t want to download a large number of mobile applications to their smartphone in order to get all necessary information and service possibilities for a single trip was the crucial factor to start a project.",,,0,,,,,,,
Currently business travelers are required to have 30 or more apps from different airports and airlines installed on their phones which does not only result in a bad usability experience but also drives heavy users to third-party applications with less trustworthy data sources.,,,0,,,,,,,
Another fact is that airlines and airports want to offer different information and services to passengers during their journey.,,,0,,,,,,,
This starts with simple information about upcoming flights or places at the airport but also includes bookable services like paid lounge access.,,,0,,,,,,,
An important goal is to give the passenger reliable and trusted information during the whole journey.,,,0,,,,,,,
The challenge is to find new ways for airports and airlines to approach the customer and to give them the possibility to distribute high quality information - including services - via many distribution channels.,,,0,,,,,,,
"To face this challenge, different approaches are conceivable.",,,0,,,,,,,
"One is to have a single common app for the whole aviation industry, which is a utopian idea and only feasible for a modest number of companies.",,,0,,,,,,,
The other one is to define a common data model and according interfaces to exchange data.,,,0,,,,,,,
This standard would allow the embedding of trusted information (including services) from all partners in other applications.,,,0,,,,,,,
One example scenario is a passenger travelling from Munich via Frankfurt to New York.,,,0,,,,,,,
"This passenger should not be forced to download the Lufthansa, Munich airport, Frankfurt airport, and JFK airport applications in order to get all travel details.",,,0,,,,,,,
Each of these apps is capable of displaying reliable information on a particular flight segment and interesting services at a specific location.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The Munich airport app could be enabled to show transfer information for the next segment (Frankfurt to New York), to book a lounge at Frankfurt Airport, or find a location and the fastest way from the baggage belt to a specific restaurant in New York.",,,0,,,,,,,
"For the airports and airline involved in this trip, Seamless Travel is a great chance to provide better information and sell more services, independent of which app the passenger downloaded.",,,0,,,,,,,
All this and much more information is available in the IT systems of the partners.,,,0,,,,,,,
The ACI ACRIS Seamless Travel data model and Web service interface will make it possible to exchange these pieces of information between all partners in a common and standardizes way.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Munich airport has started working on this topic some years in advance, so some of the definitions were used as base for the ACI ACRIS standard definition.",,,0,,,,,,,
The project management was also done by Munich airport.,,,0,,,,,,,
The standard describes the different entities with all attributes and properties.,,,0,,,,,,,
The semantic model represents the airport community common knowledge.,,,0,,,,,,,
It comprises of ideas (business concepts) and connections between the ideas and is a collection of terms in the form of diagrams made by aviation industry professionals.,,,0,,,,,,,
The standard describes all interfaces to handle transactions and exchange information corresponding the defined entities.,,,0,,,,,,,
The standard does not define which kind of services can be offered via the Seamless Travel interface.,,,0,,,,,,,
The defined interfaces can be used for direct connection between partners as well as there can be one or many platform providers / data integrators as a central connection point where the partners interlink.,,,0,,,,,,,
"In real world scenarios partners will need to have regulations or contractual agreements for their legal relationship and data exchange (e.g. SLA, privacy issues).",,,0,,,,,,,
"Because these details differ for each relationship, they are not defined in this project’s context.",,,1,,,,,,,
One of the first tasks for the project group was to define relevant B2B and B2C use cases.,,,0,,,,,,,
"As there are different perspectives regarding airport, airline, provider and passenger, the use cases where clustered as shown in the diagram below.",,,0,,,,,,,
As described in 3.4 Sparxsystems Enterprise Architect is used for specifying the ACRIS Semantic Model including use cases.,,,0,,,,,,,
This whole chapter is the Enterprise Architect representation of the use cases.,,,0,,,,,,,
The Seamless Travel use cases have been collected and categorised according to their area of interest.,,,0,,,,,,,
These areas are intended to align with the ACI Semantic Model concepts.,,,0,,,,,,,

Therefore the application has to save a new Trip-Wrapper and guide the user to complete the trip information.,,,,1,,,,,,
The user clicks/taps on an visual element (e.g. button) to create a new trip.,,,,0,,,,,,
The application saves this information and shows the new trip in a list.,,,,0,,,,,,
The user clicks/taps on an visual element (e.g. button) to create a new trip.2.,,,,0,,,,,,
The user has the trip details view open showing all flights/services/… for that particular trip.,,,,0,,,,,,
The application removes the item from the trip and stores the updated trip.,,,,0,,,,,,
There for different service fields have different importance for calculating the relevance.,,,,0,,,,,,
The result is requested with a length (number of items) and offset (position of the first item to be transferred) to reduce traffic.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The application shows a search bar, up to three recommended services and a list of all categories.",,,,0,,,,,,
There has to be a view to show all the information about the Trip the application has collected during the interaction with the user.,,,,0,,,,,,
The user clicks/taps on the trip from the list showing all trips.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The application shows a list of all elements (flights, booked services, …) for that trip.",,,,0,,,,,,

"The relationships are termed ‘facts’, and these should be verifiable by a business user.",,,,0,,,,,,
"For example, a passenger (Party) creates a service bookmark (Information Content).",,,,0,,,,,,
The following diagram shows the logical model derived from the Concept Map.,,,,0,,,,,,
This illustrates the information items with the appropriate attributes.,,,,0,,,,,,
This is used to generate the physical interface model.,,,,0,,,,,,
"As these three files build on one another, they are not to be updated without reflecting these changes in the others.",,,,1,,,,,,
Any change in the implementation guidelines for example would need to be reflected in the supporting files as well.,,,,0,,,,,,
Version 1.0 was approved by the ACI World Airport IT Standing Committee (WAITSC).,,,,0,,,,,,
"If show-stopping bugs, discrepancies, misspellings, etc.",,,,1,,,,,,
These changes need to be brought up to the ACRIS group for approval.,,,,1,,,,,,
"If the group agrees to adopt these changes a new minor release can be created that keeps its draft status, but is released for implementation.",,,,1,,,,,,
"New features, major renaming or other changes that affect the standard and its implementers are supposed to be developed within a working group and to be submitted to the WAITSC for approval.",,,,0,,,,,,
Unapproved changes from prior minor changes should be merged into these versions.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The goal of future changes should be on adding optional fields / interfaces that do not interfere with the existing version, especially the rolled-out instances.",,,,0,,,,,,
"From a technical standpoint, versioning either within the calls or as part of the URL would make sense to allow clients to distinguish between different versions.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Additionally, the server should include the version number of the response currently delivered as well as other (newer) versions available.",,,,0,,,,,,
This standard was developed within the ACI ACRIS Seamless Travel Working Group.,,,,0,,,,,,
Regarding technical questions there currently is no formal support of any kind.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Since Munich Airport was heavily involved in the development of this standard and has a running instance of Seamless Travel in production, feel free to send your inquiries to the Munich team – however there is no guarantee to receive quick response (as in commercial support).",,,,1,,,,,,
"The purpose of this document is to provide information to the FDP Executive Committee sufficient to allow their endorsement of the development, maintenance, hosting, and use of an on-line FDP Expanded Clearinghouse system [see http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/fdp/PGA_171520].",,,,0,,,,,,
"This document explains the high-level technical and functional requirements, and provides information about the roles and responsibilities needed to support such a system, including the obligations of FDP and the obligations of other parties.",,,,0,,,,,,
The document also includes a cost estimate for developing and maintaining this type of system for FDP members.,,,,0,,,,,,
"It does not include details about expanding access to the system to non- FDP members, though the system will be designed in such a way to permit such an expansion.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This Functional and Technical Requirements Document outlines the functional, performance, security and other system requirements identified by the FDP Expanded Clearinghouse System Development Working Group (EC-SDWG) as the proposed information system solution for the Expanded Clearinghouse.",,,,0,,,,,,
The content of on-line profiles is expected to mirror the content currently found in the Expanded Clearinghouse pilot profiles found at: http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/fdp/PGA_171219.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The scope of this work includes the initial development of the web based system, based on information and feedback gathered during the Phase 1 Pilot.",,,,0,,,,,,
References to future development considerations are included in this proposal for information purposes only.,,,,0,,,,,,
Points of Contact relevant to this project are listed on the first page of this proposal.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Once the project has received Executive Committee approval, this document will serve as a formal MOU detailing the agreed upon responsibilities and requirements.",,,,1,,,,,,
A representative from each organization will be asked to sign the document documenting their organization’s acceptance of its roles and responsibilities.,,,,0,,,,,,
This working group will be responsible for the administrative oversight and operations of the Clearinghouse system as detailed in the next section.,,,,0,,,,,,
UW will serve as part of the system development group and provide back-up development and technical support should it be needed.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The FDP will serve as the ultimate oversight, in the form of the FDP Executive Committee to ensure appropriate review, support and approval is provided throughout Phase 2.",,,,0,,,,,,
All other information must be reviewed at least annually.,,,,0,,,,,,
No subscriber will be suspended without having first had an opportunity to cure.,,,,0,,,,,,
"There is currently no single, on-line electronic database containing all information needed for pass-through entities to perform risk assessments and to do ongoing monitoring of static or annualized data related to subrecipient monitoring.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Select data are instead housed in certain federal government systems, such as the System for Award Management (SAM) or the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) with the remainder retained by the individual entities themselves.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Certain data expected under the Uniform Guidance to be used for this purpose are as yet unavailable nationally to pass-through entities, including copies of A- creating data collection documents used with each other at time of subaward issuance or updating.",,,,0,,,,,,
The plethora of forms coupled with most institutions collecting data on a per-subaward basis rather than on a per-entity basis has led to significant administrative burden without commensurate benefit from a risk management perspective.,,,,1,,,,,,
The FDP Expanded Clearinghouse Phase 1 Pilot created a process whereby each pilot entity could provide a standard set of data and answers to questions in the form of an Entity Profile.,,,,0,,,,,,
These Entity Profiles are currently maintained in excel and converted to pdf for to a centralized web site repository.,,,,0,,,,,,
Data relative to administrative burden relief is being captured and will be reported quarterly beginning Fall 2016, early data suggest the relief will be meaningful.,,,,0,,,,,
"The profiles themselves generally require updating at least twice per year, resulting in significant ongoing burden.",,,,1,,,,,,
"In addition, download of data for use in local systems is not available.",,,,0,,,,,,
"These results, along with the remarkable success of the original FDP Financial Conflict of Interest Clearinghouse that was eventually opened to non-FDP members and now includes more than 1000 entities, signified a need to change to a more automated and electronically robust process for the longer term.",,,,1,,,,,,
This proposal reflects the FDP’s efforts to build that electronically robust system.,,,,0,,,,,,
"At designated intervals (at least monthly), the system sends an email reminding entities to update their System will also be able to send reminders on certain data elements when the data has become out of date (SAM expiration date, Audit date, etc) A list of these data elements will be developed by the ECWG and provided to the ECSDWG.",,,,1,,,,,,
System provides designated FDP administrators with additional rights.,,,,0,,,,,,
"FDP Administrators create new entities and approve new profiles FDP Administrators can create, edit, and disable user accounts.",,,,0,,,,,,
The FDP Expanded Clearinghouse Web-based system will require an initial team of developers and testers.,,,,1,,,,,,
These roles will be filled by the EC-SDWG on a volunteer basis.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The project will require administrative, project management, and training duties that will be performed by the ECWG.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Any financial management needs of this project will be coordinated through David Wright, Mark Sweet and Pamela Webb with the FDP Executive Committee.",,,,0,,,,,,
To support the ongoing needs of this system the FDP will require an oversight committee to oversee and manage the system and the community’s data to ensure ongoing reliability and integrity of the system (ECWG).,,,,1,,,,,,
"It is expected that once built, this system will exist on an ongoing basis with at least an annual review process build in to determine effectiveness, needs for updating or changes, potential need for termination, or other circumstances.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Entities will have access to their data and reporting, but publication of community-wide data will be authorized by the FDP Executive Committee.",,,,0,,,,,,
In anticipation that the web-based FDP Expanded Clearinghouse will eventually replace the various data collection components currently maintained by or through FDP we expect the long-term overall impact to FDP to streamline the type of data currently being housed on the FDP webpage.,,,,0,,,,,,
Users will interact with the system in real-time via the web.,,,,0,,,,,,
FDP members will be expected to acquire and maintain a secure and reliable internet connection adequate to facilitate data entry by their staff.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Questions on the system in general, data entry, reporting and use will be facilitated by the FDP Expanded Clearinghouse Working Group.",,,,0,,,,,,
"FDP pilot institutions are required to alter their current subrecipient entity forms and internal processes to accommodate the expected data collection and data entry, including timeliness.",,,,1,,,,,,
"All user information, guidance and FAQ’s will be developed by the ECWG and EC-SDWG and maintained on the FDP webpage.",,,,0,,,,,,
"All Pilot entities will have access to instructions and training materials to access to the system, including FAQ’s regarding the system.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The FDP Expanded Clearinghouse will be maintained in the current Excel spreadsheet / PDF repository fashion until such time as a web-based system has been developed, testing and fully adopted.",,,,1,,,,,,
Pilot entities will be required to assist in the transition between methods/systems.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Basic data logic warnings (e.g., Gender: Male with Pregnancy status: Y) Manual review and validation of new draft entity profiles by a designated FDP administrator, prior to profiles being added to the system.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The system is intended to be available online 24 hours per day, 365 days per year with the exception of scheduled and pre- notified system maintenance downtimes, if needed.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Data will become immediately available for use, except for new profiles, which will be pending in queue for validation by an FDP administrator.",,,,1,,,,,,
The ECSDWG will ensure that system resources are adequate for timely response times and overall software functionality.,,,,0,,,,,,
The ECSDWG will review ISP/hosting provider options and once the initial development is complete will move the clearinghouse over to this for hosting the system.,,,,1,,,,,,
The system will be built and tested on Vanderbilt hardware and software and then transferred over based on agreement of ECSDWG.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The cost an ISP/hosting provider is estimated to be approximately $1,200 annually.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Temporary inaccessibility, even up to several days, will not create a substantial burden on any user.",,,,1,,,,,,
The host site for the system will be chosen so as to include data backup capabilities and protocols.,,,,0,,,,,,
"VUMC will maintain a copy of the code on Vanderbilt’s network, which has daily backup protocols.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Additionally, should the ECSDWG believe it to be prudent, a copy could be kept at University of Washington or another backup site.",,,,0,,,,,,
It is expected that with the use of an IPS/hosting provider that downtime will be minimal or non-existent.,,,,1,,,,,,
"The proposed FDP Expanded Clearinghouse system will consist of a web-based, centralized database Entity Profile and reporting to be utilized in the support of ongoing subrecipient entity monitoring activities and responsibilities by the Entities.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Generally, all users will provide direct input into the system and outputs (reports) will also be generated directly from the system.",,,,0,,,,,,
"However, to ensure growth ability, flexibility is also required for both input and output modes.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Participating Pilot Entities will provide input (i.e., entity level data) and the ECSDWG, as an agent of the FDP, will provide system administration and support for report generation.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The system is planned to be originally developed principally by staff at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, in close consult with the ECSDWG.",,,,0,,,,,,
"As feasible and agreed upon, David Wright and Jason Myers might also assist in components of the development.",,,,0,,,,,,
An additional desired functionality of the system is to integrate with other external systems.,,,,0,,,,,,
The FDP Expanded Clearinghouse system will be desired to have the capacity to import and export data without ongoing support by the ECSDWG.,,,,0,,,,,,
"To this end, the system will expose a RESTful API via HTTP to provide data in JSON format for external consumer access.",,,,1,,,,,,
The clearinghouse system will also include the functionality to interface with the federal System for Award Management (SAM) web services to access certain data elements as defined in the functional requirements.,,,,0,,,,,,
In addition exploration of utilizing the bulk download capabilities currently available in the Federal Audit Clearinghouse will be explored to allow for the possibility of utilizing that data for uploading entity profile data elements as well.,,,,0,,,,,,
The desirability for the ECSDWG to continually update and improve the system is a given.,,,,0,,,,,,
"However, the FDP will also require that the system be flexible and customizable to suit their needs.",,,,1,,,,,,
The complexity of the system will limit the customizations available via the administrative interface at the FDP level.,,,,1,,,,,,
"However, the code should be structured to make customizations a reasonably accessible task for a PHP programmer, and the FDP will have access to the code repository to make such changes as desired.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Any tools that will be utilized, outside of those discussed in this proposal will be discussed an agreed upon among the ECSDWG prior to use.",,,,0,,,,,,
No closed source or proprietary tools will to be used.,,,,0,,,,,,
The system will be developed under the leadership of Vanderbilt University Medical Center using industry standard web development tools and practices.,,,,0,,,,,,
"VUMC commits to develop the initial application as described in this document, and to provide additional support and development services up to 5 hours per month on an ongoing basis, without charge to FDP.",,,,0,,,,,,
Either party may pursue a transfer of maintenance responsibilities at any time.,,,,0,,,,,,
The ECSDWG will perform at least an annual review of how the system is working and whether responsibilities need to be shifted or changed in any way.,,,,0,,,,,,
"VUMC may, at its discretion, or as contracted by FDP in exchange for appropriate remuneration, provide additional support or development services beyond this commitment.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The FDP and ECSDWG will have access to the source code for the software and may work with other parties to extend, enhance, or edit the system in collaboration with VUMC provided the changes and enhancements are committed to the GitHub repository.",,,,0,,,,,,
Source code will be stored on GitHub or in another mutually agreed repository.,,,,0,,,,,,
There is no anticipated need for an end-user guide as system will include an intuitive user interface.,,,,0,,,,,,
"VUMC will provide such documentation as necessary or as requested by the ECSDWG or FDP Executive Committee for technical requirements, including but not necessarily limited to documentation of the system-to-system API.",,,,0,,,,,,
Any end-user help documentation will be developed by the ECWG.,,,,0,,,,,,
"VUMC, as the primary developer, shall retain all right and ownership in the software product including but not limited to source code, including right to license the product (but not the data) to any third party.",,,,0,,,,,,
"VUMC will grant to FDP a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to the software product and derivative works, without the right to sub-license, for FDP and its agent(s) to use the software product for its own purposes.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This shall include no more than one production instance at any time, with unlimited backup, development and test copies permitted to maintain, improve and test the software as necessary.",,,,0,,,,,,
FDP shall retain all right and ownership in its data.,,,,0,,,,,,
"VUMC shall receive a perpetual, royalty-free license to the data strictly for the purposes of maintaining, improving and supporting FDP’s installation of the software product.",,,,0,,,,,,
The ECSDWG will work together to determine where the system may need to be configurable and ensure that all parties are in agreement and parameters are appropriately documented.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Under the leadership of VUMC, the initial system will be developed in iterations.",,,,0,,,,,,
"As the developers complete portions of the application, they will make the updates available to ECSDWG for review.",,,,1,,,,,,
"These reviews are intended to keep the application development on course, addressing any miscommunications early and providing the ECSDWG with a clear understanding of how the work is progressing.",,,,0,,,,,,
The ECSDWG will review the submitted product and provide a notice of acceptance or s on changes that need to be made in a timely manner.,,,,0,,,,,,
This iterative process will repeat until ECSDWG is satisfied with the software product.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Once the parties agree that the software product is in a “Beta”, or near-final state, ECWG members be enlisted for private live testing, including entering new entity profiles, to flesh out remaining bugs and process issues to be fixed before go-live.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Once the initial system is complete, the ECSDWG will submit the software product to ECWG for final review and approval.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Additional timelines and documentation related to the go-live process will be developed, as needed including potential review and approval process by the FDP Executive Committee.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The ECSDWG will be responsible for utilizing currently existing equipment either at VUMC or the FDP, or for contracting with a web hosting service for server space.",,,,0,,,,,,
No additional equipment is anticipated at this time.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The clearinghouse application will be built with PHP version 7, an open-source web scripting language.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Data will be stored in a MySQL database, also open source.",,,,0,,,,,,
"The user interface will be developed in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.",,,,0,,,,,,
VUMC will be employing components from standard and commonly accepted libraries such as PHP Symfony and jQuery for Javascript.,,,,0,,,,,,
PHP dependencies will be managed via the Composer package manager.,,,,0,,,,,,
The application will be able to run on any web server that supports PHP 7 and has a MySQL database.,,,,0,,,,,,
The ECSDWG will be responsible for securing the necessary server space.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The application code will use Git version control, and all commits will be archived in a designated repository which can be made available to other ECSDWG members.",,,,0,,,,,,
Source code will be stored on a mutually agreed platform.,,,,0,,,,,,
"If FDP so desires, Vanderbilt will provide server space for hosting the application.",,,,1,,,,,,
"If FDP decides to have the application hosted on a third-party’s servers, Vanderbilt will work with the hosting provide to assure that it meets the needs of the application developers.",,,,1,,,,,,
This domain will be configured to point to the web servers used for this project.,,,,0,,,,,,
We anticipate this will be a minimal time commitment (less than 1 hour per week).,,,,0,,,,,,
The bidder must indicate its compliance / non-compliance to the requirements and should substantiate its response in the space provided below.,,,,0,,,,,,
"If more space is required to justify compliance, please ensure that the substantiation is clearly cross-referenced to the relevant requirement.",,,,1,,,,,,
Describe the level of integration and solutions supported.,,,,0,,,,,,
The solution must normalize common event fields (i.e. network.,,,,0,,,,,,
The solution must provide near-real-time analysis as well as functionality.,,,,0,,,,,,
The solution must provide the ability to correlate information across potentially disparate devices.,,,,0,,,,,,
The solution must provide the ability to transmit alerts using solutions.,,,,0,,,,,,
The solution must limit the presentation of multiple similar alerts.,,,,0,,,,,,
The solution must support the ability to correlate against 3rd vulnerability scan results.,,,,0,,,,,,
These 3rd party data feeds should be updated automatically by the solution.,,,,0,,,,,,
The solution must provide bi-directional integration with 3rd operations staff may use to guide their work?,,,,0,,,,,,
The solution must support multiple display points in different SOC.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Providers are accountable for the overall project and shall ensure that all personnel, subcontractors and consultants are managed and comply with all requirements.",,,,0,,,,,,
Human Resources and Training now combined in new Section 12.,,,,0,,,,,,
Duplication in risk management requirements between former Section 2 and 7 removed.,,,,0,,,,,,
Appendix 4 added giving Guidance on Competency Assessment.,,,,0,,,,,,
The purpose of this document is to provide details for NERS Providers (Providers) of the requirements they need to meet for accreditation under the National Electricity Registration Scheme (NERS).,,,,0,,,,,,
"The document details the assessment criteria against which Providers will be measured in respect of key legislation, safety, quality, environmental, competency and technical issues covering the various scopes of registration established by the Scheme Advisory Panel.",,,,0,,,,,,
The aim of NERS is to facilitate competition in the provision of new infrastructure connections in the electricity utility sector.,,,,0,,,,,,
The Registration scheme assessment process seeks appropriate evidence that Providers wishing to perform the activities for which they seek accreditation understand and comply with all the necessary technical and legislative requirements to satisfy the electricity distribution industry criteria for adoption of the installed assets.,,,,0,,,,,,
Provider compliance is demonstrated by means of a thorough assessment of Provider’s procedures and processes prior to work commencing and a technical audit of work in progress.,,,,0,,,,,,
An essential feature of the accreditation process is to provide assurance that the practices and procedures against which accreditation is awarded are consistently applied and maintained.,,,,0,,,,,,
Hence work being carried out and supporting procedures are regularly checked throughout the accreditation period.,,,,1,,,,,,
In addition to specifying the technical requirements this document outlines (in Appendix 1) the process for accrediting Providers under the scheme and details what needs to be done to maintain accreditation.,,,,0,,,,,,
In NERS there is a 2nd tier National Electricity Registration Scheme specifically for civil contractors who are supervised by NERS accredited Providers awarded the contestable work.,,,,0,,,,,,
This scheme has limited bounds of responsibility and scopes of work which are detailed in Appendix 2 of this document.,,,,0,,,,,,
Accreditation – see Appendix 1 for details of the accreditation process and the arrangements covering the granting of ‘Partial’ and ‘Full’ accreditation.,,,,0,,,,,,
Accreditation Body – an organisation which undertakes the assessment of the competence of Providers in accordance with the Scheme and has been approved for doing so by the Scheme Advisory Panel.,,,,0,,,,,,
Accreditation Certificate – a certificate awarded to a Provider by the Accreditation Body for a scope(s) of work assessed under the Scheme.,,,,0,,,,,,
Accreditation Period – ‘Partial’ accreditation validity is for a term of 1 year and ‘Full’ accreditation validity is for a term of 3 years.,,,,0,,,,,,
Accredited NERS Provider – any organisation which has been assessed as competent in accordance with the scheme and has been issued with a valid and current Accreditation Certificate.,,,,0,,,,,,
Adopting Utility – the Company which will be adopting the constructed asset.,,,,0,,,,,,
Assessing Officer – A person appointed by the Provider to assess the competency of individuals nominated for appointment as competent persons and for recommending them for authorisation by the Authorising Officer.,,,,0,,,,,,
Assessment – objective and detailed evaluation of the Provider to determine their capability in accordance with the Scheme criteria.,,,,0,,,,,,
The person appointed by the Provider as responsible for formally assigning competencies based upon the recommendations of the Assessing Officer.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Certificate of Competence - is a formal Provider recognisable document, dated with a 3 year certification period confirmed by the signature of the Provider Assessing and Authorising officers, which states that an individual has been assessed as competent to perform specified work activities, within the accredited scopes of the Provider.",,,,0,,,,,,
This certificate of competence shall be issued to persons whose work includes that undertaken by a craftsperson and/or a craftsperson’s mate and is in addition to the requirement of a NERS Passport and any certificates / authorisations required by an adopting utility.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Competency – a combination of qualifications, training, knowledge, experience, aptitude and fitness for the job.",,,,0,,,,,,
Craftsperson – a person who has been trained to undertake specific tasks associated with the installation and/or construction of electrical plant or equipment.,,,,0,,,,,,
"For scheme purposes these include cable jointers, overhead electrical linespersons, electrical fitters and mates to those skills.",,,,0,,,,,,
Deficiency – the identified absence of or a failure to implement or maintain one or more of the specified criteria.,,,,0,,,,,,
"These may be characterised as major, minor or observations as defined within Section 1.3.",,,,0,,,,,,
Energy and Utility Skills Register (EUSR) – is a proposed web accessible database register of competencies.,,,,0,,,,,,
NERS Provider (Provider) – a company meeting the requirements for accreditation and which has been assessed as competent in accordance with the scheme requirements.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Passport (NERS Passport) – is a document that is issued by a Provider to an individual, before any work commences, to authenticate the identification of that individual and give a general record of that individuals training, competence, inductions, reviews, audits and work histories.",,,,0,,,,,,
Procedure – a specified way of carrying out a process or activity.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Where specified procedures shall be documented, they shall be version controlled with the approver/authoriser of each document identifiable.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Qualified Supervisor – a competent person appointed by the Provider who has specific and direct responsibility, for the safety, quality and technical standard of work performed by all staff under their supervision.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Safety Management System – the systems, processes and procedures, forming the Provider ‘s safe system of work, that ensure all aspects of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and all appropriate legislation and regulations relating to the work covered under the Scheme are complied with.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Second Tier Registration Scheme – a scope for civil contractors who are supervised by NERS accredited Providers and limits their work to cable laying, excavation and backfill.",,,,0,,,,,,
This scheme has limited bounds of responsibility and scopes of work which are detailed in Appendix 2.,,,,0,,,,,,
The general requirements of NERS as defined in this document.,,,,0,,,,,,
Scheme Advisory Panel – Governing Body for the scheme-known as NERSAP (NERS Advisory Panel).,,,,0,,,,,,
Technical Advisor – A person appointed by the Provider who has the appropriate level of qualification and operational experience (subject to the relevant scopes of work undertaken/to be undertaken) to advise the Provider on the fundamentals of the industry and the scheme.,,,,0,,,,,,
The Technical Advisor may be an employee of the provider or employed on a consultancy basis.,,,,0,,,,,,
In this document the following terms have the stated meanings.,,,,0,,,,,,
The licensed company responsible for the electrical distribution network in a franchised area designated under the Electricity Act.,,,,0,,,,,,
The licensed company responsible for an electrical distribution network embedded within one the franchise areas designated under the Electricity Act.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Accreditation is a demonstration that the procedures, processes and competencies have been established by a Provider to ensure consistent delivery of the accredited scopes of work to the NERS scheme requirements in accordance with industry good practice and the adopting utility requirements.",,,,0,,,,,,
An essential feature of the approval process is the assurance that procedures and practices against which approval has been awarded is consistently applied and maintained by the Provider.,,,,0,,,,,,
"This is verified through an ongoing surveillance audit programme which checks, over the period of accreditation, work carried out and supporting procedures.",,,,0,,,,,,
Providers should establish a risk management process which evaluates ongoing risk to their accreditation status.,,,,0,,,,,,
Subcontracted aspects of their accredited scopes of work should be incorporated into this process.,,,,0,,,,,,
Accreditation can be gained in any of the scopes detailed in this section.,,,,0,,,,,,
Providers shall only do work within the specified parameters of their accreditation scope(s).,,,,0,,,,,,
"This means that they shall observe any capacity, size or geographical limitations along with any other constraints that apply to their accreditation.",,,,1,,,,,,
Where scope limitations preclude a Provider from providing a ‘complete solution’ to their (developer) client they must not have any involvement in controlling the work that falls outside the accreditation they hold.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Instead a suitably accredited Provider, or the host utility, shall separately undertake all work elements that are outside the authorised scope of the ‘original’ Provider and the adopting utility shall be notified of the arrangements that have been put into place.",,,,0,,,,,,
Where construction activities are being project managed the ‘project management’ Provider shall ensure that the work being done is within the scope of the ‘construction’ Provider.,,,,1,,,,,,
All work specification design not done by the adopting utility shall be done by a Provider holding design accreditation.,,,,0,,,,,,
"However where the new infrastructure adoption agreement issued by the adopting utility company is with a ‘construction’ or ‘project management’ Provider who does not hold design accreditation that Provider may act as the primary interface between the (developer) client, the adopting utility and the design Provider.",,,,1,,,,,,
Providers shall ensure that in performing work for which accreditation has been granted they strictly adhere to the competency requirements detailed in Section 4.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Providers wishing to operate in specific and/or all DNO geographical areas shall demonstrate through their systems and procedures their ability to mobilise effectively, efficiently and safely in accordance with relevant legislation, scheme requirements, relevant DNO standards and specifications including G81 documents.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Providers that hold accreditation in any of the construction categories are not, also, required to hold project management accreditation, in those scopes, but where Providers also/do operate as a project manager, in them, they shall adhere to the requirements specified for the project management scope.",,,,1,,,,,,
Project Management of design scopes are not available.,,,,0,,,,,,
This is because the criteria set for such a scope would require the Provider to meet the overall requirements of a full design scope thus the Provider would be capable of undertaking that scope in their own right.,,,,1,,,,,,
Accredited Providers not holding Design scope may therefore use Providers who do providing the design work is relevant to that Provider’s design accreditation.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Adopting Utility Policies, Procedures, Specifications and Codes of Practice.",,,,0,,,,,,
"These accreditation scopes apply both to Providers who either do not themselves carry out construction activities but who manage this work by subcontracting such activities to appropriately accredited Providers or to Providers holding a construction scope who wish to subcontract out activities, in other construction scopes that they don’t have the accreditation for, to other appropriately accredited Providers.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Under NERS, Project Management is not a blanket scope that covers all areas of construction activities, but is categorised in accordance with the construction activities available.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Therefore for each project management scope category, Providers are required to have documented procedures, processes and technical competencies in place to effectively manage the subcontract relationship and the quality of the work performed.",,,,1,,,,,,
The processes and procedures shall define responsibilities for the listed aspects throughout the project life cycle.,,,,0,,,,,,
Providers shall ensure that their quality control and supervisory arrangements are sufficient to ensure that the work is constructed to the required quality standards and that all adopting utility requirements are satisfied.,,,,0,,,,,,
The adequacy of these arrangements should be checked through a risk based evaluation.,,,,0,,,,,,
In case of civil and cable laying activities Providers holding Project Management of those scopes could also sub contract work in those areas to 2nd tier accredited Providers.,,,,1,,,,,,
Network Connection is the classification of works associated with the connection of new networks to the adopting utility’s existing network and is broken down into Connections and Operations Activities.,,,,0,,,,,,
Each activity has a number of scopes against which accreditation is required.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Prior to applying for these scopes the Provider should discuss with the relevant adopting utility companies and determine their implementation plan phasing, their respective interface arrangements and any pre-requisite requirement for operational scopes.",,,,1,,,,,,
"However, Providers already holding Live LV jointing do not automatically hold any Network Connection scopes.",,,,0,,,,,,
Network Connection scopes are a separate entity from Live LV Jointing and as such require additional evaluation and accreditation.,,,,1,,,,,,
Some DNO’s may require Providers to hold Live LV Jointing as a pre requisite before entering into relevant Network Connection pilot agreements.,,,,1,,,,,,
Providers should check relevant DNO’s position on this point.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The Switching of Apparatus under central or field control to facilitate a new connection, and or any associated diversion and reinforcements to an existing DNO or IDNO’s System.",,,,0,,,,,,

"The Provider shall be responsible for the issue of NERS passports to ‘labour only’ subcontractors, the only exemption shall be temporary unskilled labour employed on a site for 5 days or less.",,,,,1,,,,,
Should the craftsperson or other operative gain employment with a different Service Provider then the individual would retain the passport and the responsibility for updating the passport would transfer to the new employer.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Because craftsperson’s and operatives may already hold a NERS passport (issued by a former employer who was an accredited Provider) then, when inducting new employees/’labour only’ sub-contractors, Providers shall check if they already have a passport that satisfies them and the scheme requirements.",,,,,1,,,,,
"If an individual already holds such a passport then the Provider need not issue a new one but shall, through their Assessing Officer, review and update information within them relevant to their new employment.",,,,,1,,,,,

Compliance with the requirements specified in this document will enable Provider to gain and maintain scheme accreditation.,,,,,1,,,,,
This section provides guidance on how scheme accreditation operates and the actions that will be taken in the event of non-compliance with the scheme requirements.,,,,,1,,,,,
The actual contractual terms and conditions will be those issued by the Accreditation Body when a formal quotation is sent to the Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,
Once a Provider has been assessed as satisfactorily performing the activities for which approval is sought a certificate of accreditation will be awarded which details the scope of approved activities.,,,,,1,,,,,
"At this stage the name of the Provider, along with the scope of works for which they are approved, will be added to the list on the accreditation body website.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Once they achieve Full accreditation, the Provider will be able to display the quality mark associated with the scheme.",,,,,1,,,,,
"To assist Providers preparing for assessment, especially those who are new to scheme accreditation in any utility sector, a desktop review or gap analysis is usually undertaken.",,,,,1,,,,,
Having gained Full accreditation the work and processes of the Provider are monitored by means of regular surveillance visits.,,,,,1,,,,,
"For Partial Accreditation the procedures, processes and documentation of the Provider are assessed for completeness and compliance with the requirements of the scheme.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Where such procedures and documentation are already in place, their implementation will be assessed.",,,,,1,,,,,
Subject to the outcome of this assessment Partial Accreditation may be awarded entitling the Provider to tender and obtain work which can then be used to demonstrate site activities during an assessment for Full Accreditation.,,,,,1,,,,,
Where a Provider has yet to recruit staff at the Partial accreditation stage they shall demonstrate that their recruitment strategy will ensure that competent personnel are in place before any work is commenced.,,,,,1,,,,,
"For the assessment Providers should ensure that the Accreditation Body’s representatives have access to those parties responsible for direct delivery of the work within the company and those who support the activity together with related processes, documentation and equipment.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The extent of assessment will be determined by the Accreditation Body having regard to the range, scale and geographical spread of work for which accreditation is sought.",,,,,0,,,,,
Following an assessment Providers will be given a month to provide whatever evidence is needed to close- out any identified deficiencies.,,,,,1,,,,,
After this period the Accreditation Body will issue a report concluding the evaluation and summarising the findings.,,,,,1,,,,,
At this stage the need for any further evaluation time to review deficiency close-out will be identified.,,,,,1,,,,,
Partial accreditation remains valid for 1 year by which time it should be upgraded to full accreditation by means of an on-site assessment.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Providers will be subject to a surveillance visit to establish that the required procedures, processes and competencies remain in place.",,,,,1,,,,,
If these requirements are not demonstrated the Partial accreditation will lapse.,,,,,1,,,,,
Providers with Partial accreditation shall inform the accreditation body as soon as any work which requires accreditation is obtained so that an assessment for Full Accreditation can be arranged.,,,,,1,,,,,
Where the Accreditation Body identifies that a Provider with Partial Accreditation has been carrying out work without notifying the Accreditation Body their accreditation will be terminated.,,,,,1,,,,,
When a Provider demonstrates that they meet the requirements for Partial accreditation the Accreditation Body will issue a Certificate of Partial Accreditation, such certificates will remain the property of the Accreditation Body and shall be returned to them on their request.,,,,,1,,,,
Major deficiencies identified at the Full evaluation stage can lead to the accreditation body terminating the Partial accreditation of the Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,
The Full Accreditation of the Provider is dependent on the satisfactory technical assessments of activities for which accreditation are sought.,,,,,1,,,,,
To achieve Full Accreditation for any particular element of the requested scope then those elements shall be carried out by the Provider (or managed by the Provider if appropriate to the Provider’s scope) and witnessed and assessed by the accreditation body.,,,,,1,,,,,
"In order to progress from Partial Accreditation to Full Accreditation, Providers shall make each activity available for assessment at the first possible opportunity.",,,,,1,,,,,
Where work covering the full range of the scope requested is not witnessed the Accreditation Body will restrict any accreditation to the scope of work reviewed.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Award of Full Accreditation requires that procedures and processes assessed for Partial Accreditation, but previously untried, are fully implemented and are operating effectively.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Providers shall also demonstrate a full understanding of the specific adopting utility requirements, specification details and contact arrangements.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The Providers shall be fully prepared for the assessment by the Accreditation Body’s representative, and shall ensure the availability of appropriate personnel, documentation and site activities.",,,,,0,,,,,
Facilities and access to sites shall be arranged by the Provider in order that the Accreditation Body can witness all appropriate work activities.,,,,,1,,,,,
Subject to satisfactory performance throughout the accreditation process Full Accreditation will remain valid for 3 years after which time a reassessment will be carried out.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Following completion of the assessment, and on acceptance of the ongoing surveillance program, the Accreditation Body will issue an Accreditation Certificate which will be valid for the term of the accreditation.",,,,,1,,,,,
The certificate will remain the property of the Accreditation Body and shall be returned to them on their request.,,,,,1,,,,,
Providers will receive a quotation in the form of a Request for Services (RFS) for scopes applied for.,,,,,1,,,,,
"This RFS must be agreed, and signed, by the Provider, prior to the assessment process commencing.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Following completion of the appropriate evaluation stage, Providers will be invoiced accordingly and shall be required to pay such charges promptly in accordance with the requirements as outlined in the Terms and Conditions in the RFS.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Where any payments become overdue, the Accreditation Body will be unable to commit to further services.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Dependent on status the Provider may, in some cases, be required to pre-pay all or a portion of the agreed RFS before the evaluation commences.",,,,,1,,,,,
Having gained accreditation the work and adherence to process of Providers will be monitored through routine surveillance visits.,,,,,1,,,,,
The accreditation body will also respond to any reports of non-compliance.,,,,,0,,,,,
Surveillance visits and any extra visits needed to investigate substantiated reports of non-compliance will be chargeable to the Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,

"For those Providers with Network Connection construction scopes, the Accreditation Body shall endeavor to carry out unannounced surveillance visits as part of the surveillance programme, where this is practical taking into consideration the type of work being undertaken, the project duration, the notice requirements of the adopting utility’s interface arrangements and the liaison arrangements in place between the Accreditation Body and the adopting utility.",,,,,1,,,,,
Each approved activity scope and the Provider’s management system shall be subject to surveillance audit at least once during the three year accreditation period with the first surveillance visit held within a 6 months (maximum) of accreditation being awarded.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The surveillance programme is subject to a minimum of 6 visits throughout the accreditation period for construction activities, project management and/or control and management of constructions activities.",,,,,1,,,,,
In the case of Providers who only hold design scopes that minimum is 4 visits.,,,,,1,,,,,
The number of visits will increase above the minimum dependent on the number and type of scopes held.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The Accreditation Body may, at its discretion and subject to reasonable notice, vary the interval between surveillance visits, based upon the results of Provider/Adopting Utility/Accreditation Body audits.",,,,,1,,,,,
Findings of Surveillance visits shall be documented and any deficiencies recorded shall be highlighted to the Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,
Appropriate timescale for the close out of deficiencies should be agreed.,,,,,0,,,,,
"For those Providers with Network Connection construction scopes- if any major deficiencies are identified whilst the work is being undertaken then the Accreditation Body will report the matter, immediately, to the adopting utility and Provider.",,,,,1,,,,,
The Provider’s Network Connections scope accreditation may be suspended depending on the circumstances and may be subject to investigation.,,,,,1,,,,,
"If the Provider’s staff are not in the location notified to the adopting utility the Accreditation Body may, in the absence of a reasonable explanation, suspend the Provider’s accreditation.",,,,,1,,,,,
The Accreditation Body may also charge for an aborted visit if the surveillance visit has to be re-scheduled.,,,,,1,,,,,
Arrangements for routine surveillance visits will be agreed between the accreditation body and the Provider in accordance with the surveillance schedule specified at the time of accreditation.,,,,,0,,,,,
This arrangement will take account of the number of scopes of accreditation and subject to A.1.3.5 the scopes of work they are in.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Should the volume of the Provider’s work, or scope of the Provider accreditation, change during the accreditation period then the surveillance visit programme shall be revised accordingly.",,,,,1,,,,,
Where concerns about the compliance of a Provider are made to the accreditation body by adopting utilities or others additional investigation surveillance visits will be immediately arranged.,,,,,1,,,,,
If the non- compliance issue investigated is confirmed the Provider will be required to cover the cost of the investigation.,,,,,1,,,,,
The accreditation body will routinely advise Provider of the surveillance visit schedule (covering site and office activities).,,,,,0,,,,,
Providers shall arrange with the Accreditation Body for surveillance visits to be undertaken no later than a month after the month specified in the schedule.,,,,,0,,,,,
In order that work activities can be assessed Providers shall make reasonable provision for contestable work to be available for surveillance.,,,,,1,,,,,
Where it is necessary to change pre-arranged visits Providers should give a minimum of 5 working days’ notice to the accreditation body.,,,,,1,,,,,
Where a surveillance visit is cancelled within the notice period an abortive visit charge based on the charge for a surveillance visit will be made.,,,,,1,,,,,
Where the planned activities are not being carried out at the time of the visit the Accreditation Body will make a charge for a further visit to assess the activities.,,,,,1,,,,,
At least annually whilst undertaking surveillance visits the Accreditation Body expects to meet with the appointed assessing officer (relevant to the scope of work under surveillance) to ensure that they are taking active responsibility for the duties which are assigned to their roles.,,,,,1,,,,,
During the accreditation period the Accreditation Body expects to see all the accredited scopes being demonstrated.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Where scopes of work may be infrequently carried out by the Provider, the Accreditation Body may, taking into account the general compliance of the Provider relax the frequency they expect to view such work.",,,,,1,,,,,
This arrangement will take account of the types of work the Provider normally focuses on and their surveillance programme and will only be allowed when the Provider agrees to notify the Accreditation Body every time work on the ‘infrequently’ performed scope(s) is being done.,,,,,1,,,,,
Categories of work carried out infrequently may include the overhead line and higher voltage scopes (e.g.,,,,,0,,,,,
Other than for scopes of work which are done infrequently (see Section A1.3.3) in the event that the Provider’s programme of work does not incorporate any work meeting the requirements for a surveillance visit for a period which extends beyond one month of the surveillance visit due date then the accreditation status of the Provider shall be downgraded to Partial.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Under these circumstances the surveillance visit programme shall be suspended and annual (on the anniversary of the last surveillance visit) visits arranged to ensure that competency and procedures/processes, against which the initial accreditation was awarded, are maintained.",,,,,1,,,,,
As required for all holders of partial accreditation Providers who have had their accreditation status downgraded must notify the Accreditation Body of their intention to start any work relating to their accreditation so that a surveillance visit can be arranged.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Subject to the surveillance visit confirming that work is being done in accordance with the scheme requirements, and that the required procedures and processes are in place, then full accreditation shall be reinstated and a programme of surveillance visits re- established.",,,,,1,,,,,
If a Provider considers that their ongoing workload is less than that used to determine the surveillance visit programme they should notify the Accreditation Body and ask for the programme to be re-assessed.,,,,,1,,,,,
"However, as a minimum, to retain full accreditation Provider shall maintain their surveillance programme presenting each scope (unless infrequently carried out- see a.1.3.3) of their fully accredited activities and relevant management system for surveillance audit over the accreditation period.",,,,,1,,,,,
Providers will be charged for surveillance visits carried out in accordance with the agreed programme or any which are subsequently arranged to close-out major deficiencies or the suspension/removal of accreditation.,,,,,1,,,,,
Where any payments to the Accreditation Body become overdue the Accreditation Body is unable to commit to doing further visits.,,,,,1,,,,,
Is found to have made false claims within the application for accreditation which are considered to impact on the integrity of the Provider.,,,,,0,,,,,
Fails to complete within the agreed timescales and to the satisfaction of the accreditation body required remedial action(s) identified during routine surveillance or any other investigation.,,,,,1,,,,,
Implementation of corrective action is subsequently found to have been inadequate to prevent a reoccurrence at any location of recently identified deficiencies.,,,,,1,,,,,
Is found to continually fail to maintain safe systems of working and has working practices which result in the workforce or members of the public being exposed to danger or serious risk of injury through the use of faulty workmanship/working practice and faulty materials or materials not conforming to recognised standards.,,,,,1,,,,,
Claims to have been approved for work not included at the time in the scope of their approval.,,,,,0,,,,,
Commits a breach of any of the obligations imposed by the adopting utility.,,,,,0,,,,,
Fails to incorporate into their procedures and working practices any changes made to the scheme by the Scheme Advisory Panel within an agreed time period.,,,,,0,,,,,
Notifies the accreditation body that they no longer wish to be accredited for scopes of work.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Where the accreditation body is notified that unsatisfactory work or non-compliance with the scheme requirements has occurred and the matter is disputed by the Provider, the accreditation body shall carry out an investigation.",,,,,1,,,,,
Under certain circumstances an interested party or Provider may wish to escalate an issue to the accreditation body for further investigation.,,,,,1,,,,,
The Provider and/or interested party shall also provide all relevant documentation relating to the work and shall ensure that the qualified supervisor responsible for the work is available.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Where the investigation is to be carried out following a complaint made by the adopting network operator or other party, the Provider shall allow the complainant to be represented during the investigation.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Where the investigation is to be carried out following a complaint made by the Provider, the interested party shall allow the complainant to be represented during the investigation.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Where, as a result of inspections, the work is shown to not to comply with the scheme requirements the Provider shall, at its own expense, take the required remedial action to remedy the work with the timescale specified by the accreditation body.",,,,,1,,,,,
The process and timescales for investigations is shown at the end of this section.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The accreditation body shall notify the Provider in writing of the intention to cancel certification, fully detailing such reasons for its action.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Normally, unless the nature of the non-conformance merits immediate action or is a reoccurrence of a recently closed deficiency, this will be in 2 stages.",,,,,1,,,,,
Firstly the Provider will be notified that their accreditation is being suspended and given a limited time to address the non-conformances giving rise to the suspension.,,,,,0,,,,,
If the non-conformances are not satisfactorily addressed during the allotted time period and steps are not taken to prevent a reoccurrence the accreditation will be cancelled.,,,,,1,,,,,
Once accreditation has been cancelled then re-accreditation will be subject to a full re-assessment of the Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,
"If the Provider wishes to object to action taken, including withdrawal of accreditation, by the accreditation body they shall, within twenty-one days of the issue of the notification to them, give notice in writing to the accreditation body of their objections setting out clearly the grounds for an appeal.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Any such appeal will be assessed by a panel within the accreditation body, independent of those members of the Accreditation Body associated with the original withdrawal action.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The results of the review will be communicated to the Provider in writing, detailing clearly the basis for the decision.",,,,,1,,,,,
If the decision is not to the satisfaction of the Provider then they can appeal to the Scheme Advisory Panel which will be furnished with the basis for the original accreditation withdrawal and the findings of the appeals review.,,,,,1,,,,,
The Scheme Advisory Panel shall be the final arbiter of all such appeals.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The Provider and accreditation body shall bear their own costs associated with any appeal, regardless of the outcome.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Re-instatement of accreditation will be effected under the conditions prescribed by the accreditation body’s review or that of the Scheme Advisory Panel, should the finding be that the accreditation withdrawal was not warranted.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Alternatively, if the appeals process finds the accreditation withdrawal to be the correct course of action then re-instatement of the Provider would entail a full re-evaluation.",,,,,1,,,,,
At the end of the 3 year full accreditation period a reassessment covering all required scopes of accreditation shall be undertaken.,,,,,1,,,,,
The scale of this reassessment will take account of the performance of the Provider during the period of accreditation.,,,,,1,,,,,
If the Provider has performed satisfactorily over the accreditation period their accreditation is likely to be reviewed with minimum examination.,,,,,1,,,,,
"However if the work carried out by the Provider is limited, or if a number of audit reports identify major deficiencies or a growing trend of minor deficiencies, an appropriately more in depth level of re-assessment will be required.",,,,,1,,,,,
The extent of the renewal assessment will take account of recently witnessed work with any scopes not seen during the previous 12 month period required to be seen during the re-assessment process.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Where this cannot be arranged the level of accreditation, subject to satisfactory verification of procedures and processes, will reduce to ‘Partial’.",,,,,1,,,,,
"However, where one of the scopes being re-assessed covers work that may be infrequently carried out (see Section A.1.3.3) then, provided the Provider has agreed this with the accreditation body and has notified all instances of the work being done, the accreditation body will take account of surveillance visits over the 3 year certification period.",,,,,1,,,,,
In such the accreditation body may re- certify at the ‘Full’ level without witnessing work being done.,,,,,1,,,,,
The Accreditation Body shall give each Provider 3 months’ notice of the expiry of their accreditation.,,,,,0,,,,,
"If the Provider does not put in place adequate accreditation renewal arrangements, or allow adequate time for the required renewal assessment to take place, the accreditation will be terminated.",,,,,1,,,,,
The reaccreditation assessment will take account of scopes viewed over the preceding 12 months and also consider whether any infrequently performed scopes have been satisfactorily demonstrated during the accreditation period.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Where scopes are not witnessed during the re-accreditation, or there is not adequate evidence to support the award of ‘Full’ accreditation, these scopes may only be awarded ‘Partial’ status.",,,,,1,,,,,
After this period of time the Accreditation Body will issue a report concluding the accreditation.,,,,,1,,,,,
Having being satisfactorily reassessed and a surveillance programme agreed the Provider will be accredited for a further 3 years.,,,,,1,,,,,
It should be d that adopting utility companies have the right to insist on defective work being corrected and the right to refuse to adopt infrastructure if it is not fit for purpose even though the work may have been carried out by an accredited Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The accreditation body will notify all adopting utility companies when action is taken to amend, suspend or terminate the accreditation of a Provider.",,,,,1,,,,,
Other information on accreditation status will be shown on the scheme specific website maintained by the accreditation body.,,,,,0,,,,,
On gaining accreditation Providers will be issued with the NERS Scheme Registration Mark (which incorporates the LR Approval Mark).,,,,,1,,,,,
"Guidance on the use of this Mark will be provided when it is issued and the Mark shall only be used in the as issued configuration and can be displayed by accredited Provider on their stationery, publicity material, company buildings, flags, vehicles, and so on.",,,,,1,,,,,
Correct use of a NERS Mark is a contractual obligation and a NERS accreditation certificate can be withdrawn if a Provider misuses a NERS Scheme Mark and continues to do this after attention has been drawn to the misuse.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Also, if NERS accreditation is withdrawn from a Provider they must stop using the NERS Scheme Mark and, where necessary, withdraw any material carrying the Mark.",,,,,1,,,,,
The 2nd tier scheme is restricted in relation to the scopes that are available and is for civil contractors who wish to hold an accreditation but with limited responsibilities.,,,,,0,,,,,
These limited but clearly defined bounds of responsibility in relation to the restricted scopes of work are detailed in this Appendix.,,,,,0,,,,,
Providers holding 2nd Tier accreditation shall not be able to compete for contestable work in their own right and can only operate as a sub-contractor to a NERS accredited Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,
Assessment for accreditation under the 2nd tier scheme only covers those areas relevant to the work being undertaken and takes into consideration the supervisory responsibilities of the NERS accredited Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,
"An induction process which should ensure that all staff undergo training in electrical safety awareness, manual handling, COSHH, drawing appreciation, risk assessment and company procedures.",,,,,1,,,,,
"A training database showing qualifications, competencies etc.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Training files holding copies of qualifications, cards etc.",,,,,0,,,,,
Issue their staff with appropriate work instructions unless a work instruction has been issued by the accredited Provider that clearly outlines the location and extent of work to be undertaken.,,,,,1,,,,,
Issue generic risk assessments and method statements to all gangs.,,,,,0,,,,,
Document the H&S responsibilities of all staff and ensure that all staff are familiar with these.,,,,,0,,,,,
Make available appropriate COSHH and manual handling assessment.,,,,,0,,,,,
Have an audit procedure that covers both H&S and quality issues.,,,,,0,,,,,
This scope of accreditation does not allow Providers to procure cable or ducting.,,,,,1,,,,,
These shall be supplied by the NERS accredited Provider.,,,,,0,,,,,
However Providers may purchase and provide storage for sand and other backfill material.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Providers shall have a procedure in place to ensure that all tools, equipment, lifting tackle etc is tested / calibrated as required.",,,,,1,,,,,
Providers shall be required to operate a safety management system covering the civil activities undertaken.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Appointment of Authorising and Assessing Officers, and Qualified Supervisors.",,,,,0,,,,,
An output from the safety management system will be a Passport issued to the Operative (see section 13 Passport and Ongoing competence Records for details on Passport requirements and content etc).,,,,,0,,,,,
The operative will need to have his ongoing competency reaffirmed on an annual basis by the Assessing Officer and his Passport updated.,,,,,0,,,,,
The assessing body will visit a site to assess the Provider competence in carrying out the works.,,,,,0,,,,,
The project management scope is for Providers who do not themselves carry out construction activities but who manage this work by subcontracting such activities to Providers with the required construction accreditation.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The scopes are also available, and can apply, to Providers holding construction scope(s) but who wish to subcontract out activities, in other construction scopes that they don’t have the accreditation for, to other appropriately accredited Providers.",,,,,0,,,,,
Many different types of project management company exist, ranging from those who simply introduce constructors to the client (developer or whoever) to those who have a detailed involvement in controlling construction activities.,,,,,0,,,,
Nevertheless there are minimum requirements expected of Providers with project management accreditation which need to be established and maintained throughout the accreditation period.,,,,,0,,,,,
Whilst these are detailed throughout the main body of the scheme requirements this summary provides an overview of the project management scope requirements to aid companies in preparing for accreditation assessments and ongoing surveillance visits.,,,,,1,,,,,
There is not normally a requirement for Providers who simply introduce contractors to the client and where the construction Provider does the entire liaison with the host utility and the on-site liaison with the client to be accredited as project managers.,,,,,1,,,,,
Provider with the required construction accreditation rather than doing the work under their direct supervision) they must demonstrate compliance with the project management scope requirements.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Although they employ an accredited Provider to undertake construction work, project management Providers need to get involved in many technical aspects of new infrastructure delivery.",,,,,0,,,,,
Hence they need to be able to demonstrate utility sector specific technical understanding and competence alongside their project management capability.,,,,,1,,,,,
Providers shall have in place a documented procedure for assessing the competence of individuals who are to carry out such work and for giving authority to those individuals to carry it out.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Scheme Requirements) and, additionally, where work is associated with craftsperson activities as defined in section 1.1 of Scheme Requirements - a certificate of competence signed by the assessing and authorising officer.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The Assessing Officer shall keep records of tests including, in the case of oral tests, oral responses given.",,,,,0,,,,,
"An assessment file should be compiled for each candidate providing background supporting evidence towards the competence required (i.e. previous authorities held, employment history, training details, experience and skills tests undertaken).",,,,,1,,,,,
The Assessing Officer may accept documented assessments of practical skills tests provided they are/were undertaken by a recognised training institution/facility.,,,,,1,,,,,
"For giving authority to an individual’s assessment of competence the Authorising Officer shall be provided the candidate’s assessment file, which shall include recommendation for the areas of work to be given authority.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The Authorisation Officer must be satisfied that the candidate has the necessary skills and ability to work safely on, or near, the existing or proposed electrical networks and that the extent and limitation of the authority being given is unequivocal.",,,,,0,,,,,
An auditable trail of the assessment process shall be maintained which when successful shall result in an entry in the craftsperson’s/operative’s passport to provide for ready site based evidence.,,,,,1,,,,,
Certificates of competence shall be required for craftsperson* individuals (as defined below and in in section 1.1 of Scheme Requirements) –and are an additional requirement to passports for these roles.,,,,,0,,,,,
There is no requirement for the issue of certificates of competence for civil and cable laying activities – however passports are also required for these roles.,,,,,0,,,,,
The certificate shall be issued following an assessment of competence conducted by the Provider’s Assessing Officer.,,,,,0,,,,,
"That assessment, if satisfactory, shall be given authority by the Provider’s Authorising Officer.",,,,,1,,,,,
The certificate shall be duly signed and dated by the Provider’s Assessing and Authorising Officers.,,,,,0,,,,,
The certificate shall include a declaration requiring signature that the holder understands and accepts the responsibilities associated with the duties detailed on it and is aware that a separate authority may be required where/before work is to be carried out on a 3rd party owned network.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Has been assessed as competent in having sufficient practical and/or technical knowledge and/or experience to enable the avoidance of danger personally and/or to others, and has also been assessed as being competent to carry out the following craftsperson tasks on electrical plant or equipment.",,,,,1,,,,,
"I am aware that a separate written authority will, or may, be required where and before work is carried out on a 3rd party owned site, system or network (this includes Distribution Network Operator and/or Independent Distribution Network I also understand that the authority indicated on the certificate, and any other authority associated with it, is only valid whilst I am employed on actual contract(s) operated by the company.",,,,,1,,,,,
As the holder of this authority I understand and accept my responsibilities associated with the duties detailed above.,,,,,1,,,,,
A procedure shall be in place for selecting and training individuals who the Provider feel may be able to undertake tasks associated with the installation/construction of electrical plant or equipment.,,,,,1,,,,,
Ensure the scope and level of training is dependent on the level of competence to be given authority and the procedure shall lay out the minimum requirement.,,,,,0,,,,,
Ensure candidates have their competency assessed in a structured way against a set of agreed criteria and trade skills.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Ensure that where training under personal supervision is undertaken the minimum requirements in terms of duration, level of responsibility and limit of work activities are clearly defined.",,,,,1,,,,,
The person providing the personal supervision shall have the necessary experience and be given authority in writing to undertake these duties.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Ensure selection, training and assessment process is documented and records maintained for all individuals even if they are unsuccessful.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Indicate responsibilities for identifying refresher training and initiating training when any changes in type of work, take place.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Ensure that before an existing assessment of competence is considered for annual renewal and thus allowed ongoing authority, a check is made that during the review period, work has been undertaken across the competence scope(s) originally given.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Include process and action where review finds that certain elements of work, across the competence scopes, have not been undertaken within the review period.",,,,,1,,,,,
Under such circumstances it may be decided that it is necessary for the jointer to perform such a joint under supervision to retain or regain that element of competence).,,,,,1,,,,,
Partial Accreditation is the first stage of accreditation.,,,,,0,,,,,
"It demonstrates that a Provider has the required systems, processes and procedures in place to meet the NERS requirements.",,,,,0,,,,,
Providers with partial accreditation can tender and obtain work for the scopes they hold.,,,,,1,,,,,
Full Accreditation is granted to Providers who have successfully demonstrated that they have adequately met the schemes requirements with respect to the construction of adoptable assets.,,,,,1,,,,,
In the case of Design Scopes the Provider has successfully demonstrated that their processes meet both the scheme and adopting company’s requirements.,,,,,1,,,,,
If a Provider’s has Project Management for a construction scope PM will appear after the voltage in the scope description i.e. Jointing (HV-PM).,,,,,1,,,,,
"Any restrictions, anomalies or additions associated with particular scopes are added to individual Provider s.",,,,,0,,,,,
To access LR web-site s click on Show contact Details in the Provider box concerned.,,,,,0,,,,,
Granted when the first site works have been witnessed successfully.,,,,,1,,,,,
The primary NERS Provider does not need to hold Design Accreditation.,,,,,0,,,,,
"They are allowed to sub-contract the design to, or use a design supplied by, a NERS Provider with the design scopes relevant to the works.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Management or Construction category, to another NERS Provider with the relevant scope.",,,,,0,,,,,
It is also applicable to NERS Providers who hold at least one construction scope and wish to sub-contract out work covered by other scopes that they do not have.,,,,,1,,,,,
In this situation they must utilise an appropriately accredited NERS Providers.,,,,,1,,,,,
Project Management scopes are not awarded for Design.,,,,,0,,,,,
These companies are known as Second Tier Providers.,,,,,0,,,,,
Live jointing only allows jointing onto the main installed by the NERS Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,
Live LV jointing covers un-metered on a hierarchal basis.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Applicable to connection work on underground, un-metered single phase, 230v services with loadings of 500 W or less.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The permanent or temporary transfer, disconnection or extension of a service to a point of supply.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Installation of a new service to such a point of supply, excluding joint onto an existing main.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Network Connections – Jointing (LV Mains and Services, LV Terminations) To include: Jointing- LV Mains & Services and Jointing – LV Terminations LV Pole, link box, LV board and LV Pillar terminations will appear, as relevant, in the Provider’s s.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Providers holding Live LV jointing do not automatically hold Networks Connections scopes which are separate entities from Live LV Jointing and which requires a separate, additional evaluation and accreditation.",,,,,1,,,,,
Jointing LV Live is a pre-requisite for a NERS Provider wishing to obtain this scope.,,,,,1,,,,,
The LV Terminations scope includes live and dead jointing.,,,,,0,,,,,
This scope covers: - Jointing HV mains and Jointing HV Terminations (HV pole & HV switchgear terminations).,,,,,0,,,,,
Cable jointing (live or dead) of single phase un-metered services to existing mains.,,,,,0,,,,,
"The definitions are taken from the ENA Model Distribution Safety Rules in which Conductors are used, or supported, or of which they form part.",,,,,0,,,,,
Apparatus are electrically connected to a common source of supply the operational scopes are still under development.,,,,,0,,,,,
Substation Installation (voltage as relevant up to and including 132kV) Scope includes responsibility for all elements of substation installation.,,,,,0,,,,,
Any restrictions however will appear in relevant Provider s.,,,,,0,,,,,
Includes overseeing specialist civil contractors who are not NERS accredited.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Jointing Scope at the appropriate voltage, the erection of the termination and associated steelwork, insulators, surge arrestors, jumpers etc.",,,,,0,,,,,
Self Determination of Point of Connection (POC) (voltage as relevant up to and DNOs may operate pilot trials for this work which is limited to specific voltages or defined capacities.,,,,,0,,,,,
Electrical Design of Distribution Networks covering (LV Cable Networks to This also covers the domestic properties on a hierarchal basis.,,,,,0,,,,,
Lloyd’s Register and Lloyd’s Register EMEA are trading names of Lloyd’s Register Group Limited and its subsidiaries.,,,,,0,,,,,
This section gives a scope description and overview of everything included in this SRS document.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Also, the purpose for this document is described and a list of abbreviations and definitions is provided.",,,,,0,,,,,
The purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the “Amazing Lunch Indicator” (ALI) software.,,,,,1,,,,,
It will illustrate the purpose and complete declaration for the development of system.,,,,,0,,,,,
"It will also explain system constraints, interface and interactions with other external applications.",,,,,0,,,,,
This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a customer for its approval and a reference for developing the first version of the system for the development team.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The “Amazing Lunch Indicator” is a GPS-based mobile application which helps people to find the closest restaurants based on the user’s current position and other specification like price, restaurant type, dish and more.",,,,,1,,,,,
The application should be free to download from either a mobile phone application store or similar services.,,,,,0,,,,,
Restaurant owners can provide their restaurant information using the web-portal.,,,,,1,,,,,
This information will act as the bases for the search results displayed to the user.,,,,,0,,,,,
An administrator also uses the web-portal in order to administer the system and keep the information accurate.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The administrator can, for instance, verify restaurant owners and manage user information.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Furthermore, the software needs both Internet and GPS connection to fetch and display results.",,,,,1,,,,,
"All system information is maintained in a database, which is located on a web-server.",,,,,0,,,,,
The software also interacts with the GPS-Navigator software which is required to be an already installed application on the user’s mobile phone.,,,,,0,,,,,
"By using the GPS-Navigator, users can view desired restaurants on a map and be navigated to them.",,,,,1,,,,,
The application also has the capability of representing both summary and detailed information about the restaurants.,,,,,0,,,,,
Any person who has interaction with the system who is not a developer.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Practice for Software Requirements Specifications”, October 20, 1998.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Marketing”, New York, Dorset House Publishing, 2005.",,,,,0,,,,,
The remainder of this document includes three chapters and appendixes.,,,,,0,,,,,
The second one provides an overview of the system functionality and system interaction with other systems.,,,,,0,,,,,
This chapter also introduces different types of stakeholders and their interaction with the system.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Further, the chapter also mentions the system constraints and assumptions about the product.",,,,,0,,,,,
The third chapter provides the requirements specification in detailed terms and a description of the different system interfaces.,,,,,0,,,,,
Different specification techniques are used in order to specify the requirements more precisely for different audiences.,,,,,1,,,,,
The fourth chapter deals with the prioritization of the requirements.,,,,,0,,,,,
It includes a motivation for the chosen prioritization methods and discusses why other alternatives were not chosen.,,,,,0,,,,,
The Appendixes in the end of the document include the all results of the requirement prioritization and a release plan based on them.,,,,,0,,,,,
This section will give an overview of the whole system.,,,,,0,,,,,
The system will be explained in its context to show how the system interacts with other systems and introduce the basic functionality of it.,,,,,0,,,,,
It will also describe what type of stakeholders that will use the system and what functionality is available for each type.,,,,,0,,,,,
"At last, the constraints and assumptions for the system will be presented.",,,,,0,,,,,
This system will consist of two parts: one mobile application and one web portal.,,,,,0,,,,,
The mobile application will be used to find restaurants and view information about them while the web portal will be used for system as a whole.,,,,,1,,,,,
The GPS will provide the for the user to be able to use the functions in the application in a seamlessly manner.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Both the the database, however in slightly different ways.",,,,,0,,,,,
The mobile application will only use the database to get data while the database communication will go over the Internet.,,,,,0,,,,,
To avoid problems with overloading the operating system the application is only allowed to use 20 megabytes of memory while running the application.,,,,,1,,,,,
The maximum amount of hard drive space is also 20 megabytes.,,,,,0,,,,,
"With the mobile application, the users will be able to search for restaurants.",,,,,1,,,,,
The result will be based on the criteria the user inputs.,,,,,0,,,,,
There are several search criteria and it will be possible for the administrator of the system to manage the options for those criteria that have that.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The result of the search will be viewed either in a list view or in a map view, depending on what criteria included in the search.",,,,,1,,,,,
The list view will have one list item for each restaurant matching the search criteria and show a small part of the restaurant information so the user can identify the restaurant.,,,,,1,,,,,
"In both views the users will be able to either select a restaurant as target destination or get information how to get there, or view the information of a specific restaurant.",,,,,0,,,,,
The web portal will provide functionality to manage the system and the restaurant information.,,,,,1,,,,,
"It will also provide information about the system, for example show when there is a new update.",,,,,1,,,,,
"There are three types of users that interact with the system: users of the mobile application, restaurant owners and administrators.",,,,,0,,,,,
Each of these three types of users has different use of the system so each of them has their own requirements.,,,,,1,,,,,
The mobile application users can only use the application to find a restaurant.,,,,,1,,,,,
"This means that the user have to be able to search for restaurants, choose a restaurant from that search and then navigate to it.",,,,,1,,,,,
In order for the users to get a relevant search result there are multiple criteria the users can specify and all results matches all of those.,,,,,1,,,,,
The restaurant owners will not use the mobile application but the web portal instead.,,,,,1,,,,,
"There they will manage the information about their restaurant, for example a description of the restaurant, contact information and their menu.",,,,,0,,,,,
The administrators also only interact with the web portal.,,,,,1,,,,,
They are managing the overall system so there is no incorrect information within it.,,,,,1,,,,,
The administrator can manage the information for each restaurant as well as the options for both the mobile application users and the restaurant owners.,,,,,1,,,,,
The mobile application is constrained by the system interface to the GPS navigation system within the mobile phone.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Since there are multiple system and multiple GPS manufacturers, the interface will most likely not be the same for every one of them.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Also, there may be a difference between what navigation features each of them provide.",,,,,0,,,,,
The Internet connection is also a constraint for the application.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Since the application fetches data from the database over the Internet, it is crucial that there is an Internet connection for the application to function.",,,,,1,,,,,
Both the web portal and the mobile application will be constrained by the capacity of the database.,,,,,0,,,,,
Since the database is shared between both application it may be forced to queue incoming requests and therefor increase the time it takes to fetch data.,,,,,1,,,,,
One assumption about the product is that it will always be used on mobile phones that have enough performance.,,,,,0,,,,,
"If the phone does not have enough hardware resources available for the application, for example the users might have allocated them with other applications, there may be scenarios where the application does not work as intended or even at all.",,,,,1,,,,,
Another assumption is that the GPS components in all phones work in the same way.,,,,,0,,,,,
"In the case that the project is delayed, there are some requirements that could be transferred to the next version of the application.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Those requirements are to be developed in the third release, see Appendix IV.",,,,,0,,,,,
This section contains all of the functional and quality requirements of the system.,,,,,0,,,,,
It gives a detailed description of the system and all its features.,,,,,0,,,,,
This section provides a detailed description of all inputs into and outputs from the system.,,,,,0,,,,,
"It also gives a description of the hardware, software and communication interfaces and provides basic prototypes of the user interface.",,,,,1,,,,,
"A first-time user of the mobile application should see the log-in page when he/she opens the application, see Figure 2.",,,,,1,,,,,
"If the user has not registered, he/she should be able to do that on the log-in page.",,,,,1,,,,,
"If the user is not a first-time user, he/she should be able to see the search page directly when the application is opened, see Figure 3.",,,,,1,,,,,
Here the user chooses the type of search he/she wants to conduct.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Every user should have a profile page where they can edit their e-mail address, phone number and password, see Figure 4.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Also, the user can set the mobile application to his/her preferred language.",,,,,0,,,,,
The “P” icon shows where the user can click to navigate to his/her profile page.,,,,,0,,,,,
"In Figure 5, the list view for the results is shown.",,,,,0,,,,,
"When a user searches by price, this view should be the default one.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The sorting header allows the user to sort the results according to price, restaurant name, distance, restaurant type and specific dish.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Each result item includes information about the restaurants, a link to the restaurant’s web-page and an information link, which provides a more detailed description of the restaurant.",,,,,0,,,,,
"There is also a filtering option, where the user can choose to filter the results by increasing or decreasing the price or distance range, see Figure 7.",,,,,0,,,,,

"In order to get a view of how to divide the requirements into different releases and what requirements should be included in which release, a prioritization of the requirements is needed.",,,,,,1,,,,
This section discusses the choice of prioritization methods and gives a suggestion of how the release plan for these requirements could look like.,,,,,,0,,,,
When prioritizing the requirements the ten most important ones were picked out first.,,,,,,1,,,,
"This was done with a simple “1 to 10” ranking method, with one being “not important” and ten “very important”.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Based on the elicitation meetings, and the perceived ideas of what was important to the different stakeholders, a number was set for each requirement.",,,,,,1,,,,
The numbers were then summed up for each requirement and the ten with the highest score were chosen to be prioritized with the cost value approach.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The results, which are red-marked, can be seen in Appendix I and as shown, it turned out to be five functional requirements and five quality requirements.",,,,,,0,,,,
These requirements were then prioritized according to the cost value approach and the results can be viewed under Appendix II.,,,,,,1,,,,
The remaining requirements were prioritized according to the “Five-Way Priority Scheme” as shown in Appendix III.,,,,,,0,,,,
This method was chosen since it gives the different stakeholders the same importance and has an enough wide range for determining which requirement is more important than the other [3].,,,,,,0,,,,
"However, in this prioritization process, the development team was not included as a stakeholder since the different features were not considered to be as important to them as for the other stakeholders.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Other methods for prioritization, such as the hundred-dollar test and the yes-no vote, were also considered.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The hundred-dollar test is quite similar to the five-way priority scheme, since it also gives a wide range for ranking the requirements.",,,,,,0,,,,
"However, it is more easily misused since someone could save all their money and put them on a requirement that they think is very important [3].",,,,,,1,,,,
Others might not agree that this requirement is important but it might still get the most votes since one person cared about it [3].,,,,,,0,,,,
"The yes-no vote method might be fairly simple to carry out, however the range is too narrow.",,,,,,0,,,,
"For instance, if two requirements are not very important it would be hard to determine which of those requirements that is more important than the other [3].",,,,,,1,,,,
"In conclusion, weighing the disadvantages and advantages of these methods against each other lead us to choose the five-way priority scheme.",,,,,,1,,,,
The requirements were divided into three releases based on the prioritization and their dependencies.,,,,,,0,,,,
The three different releases were assembled so that each would work as a fully functional application.,,,,,,1,,,,
"In the first release the requirements that build up the foundation of the application were included, together with the most highly prioritized requirements and their dependencies.",,,,,,0,,,,
The second release also includes important requirements.,,,,,,0,,,,
"However, these requirements are not vital for a functional application.",,,,,,1,,,,
They are more suited to act as additional features that can contribute to making the software product more attractive.,,,,,,1,,,,
The third release includes the requirements that can be afforded to discard if the project gets delayed or overruns the budget.,,,,,,1,,,,
"For further details about the release plan, see Appendix IV.",,,,,,0,,,,
This document has been produced in the context of the MACC-II project (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate - Interim Implementation).,,,,,,0,,,,
The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7 THEME [SPA.2011.1.5-02]) under grant agreement n° 283576.,,,,,,1,,,,
"All information in this document is provided ""as is"" and no guarantee or warranty is given that the information is fit for any particular purpose.",,,,,,0,,,,
The user thereof uses the information at its sole risk and liability.,,,,,,0,,,,
"For the avoidance of all doubts, the European Commission has no liability in respect of this document, which is merely representing the authors view.",,,,,,1,,,,
This document compiles a complete set of user requirements for the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service at the end of the MACC-III project.,,,,,,0,,,,
"It contains as its main content in a tabulated form all initial requirements raised by the Implementation Group and additional requirements collected by MACC, MACC-II in its 2 periods and MACC-III through all means of user interaction (questionnaire, bi-lateral interaction, user workshops, user advisory board, analysis of relevant GEMS projects and further applicable documents from g. PASODOBLE and PROMOTE, online user queries tool).",,,,,,0,,,,
This update (v6.0) is compatible in its requirement numbering to the earlier version v5.0.,,,,,,0,,,,
The document explores the key user requirements of both Copernicus downstream services and of the intermediate and end users of MACC core services.,,,,,,0,,,,
Version 1.1 included the evaluation of 11 additional questionnaires received after iterating version 1.0 of the document.,,,,,,1,,,,
Moreover feedback of users (e.g. the local urban user group) through circulation by the user advisory board has been implemented into the user requirements.,,,,,,0,,,,
Version 2.0 (MACC) included the response to each of the user requirements by the MACC services and additional users with their requirements (e.g. downstream services ENDORSE and ObsAIRve).,,,,,,0,,,,
Most requirements could be met (e.g. the request to cover Iceland and Turkey fully (both are EEA member states) by the MACC models has been raised by EEA) or was dealt with during MACC-II but some are at least partly out of scope for the MACC services.,,,,,,1,,,,
The version 2.0 was submitted to user review and upgraded according to feedback.,,,,,,1,,,,
Version 3.0 was based on the former version document according to the user feedback.,,,,,,0,,,,
"In the next version 4.1 (at the end of period 1 of Implementation Group for the GMES Atmosphere Core Service, specifically in chapters parameters for air quality, climate forcing, O3/UV, renewable energies), 5.1 (Functionality) and Annex 3 (Detailed outputs), have been integrated into the documentation of User Requirements for MACC-II.",,,,,,0,,,,
The final MACC-II issue (v5.0) achieved a re-structuring to put in the focus the tabulated list of user requirements (section 2.1) and integrated in these tables the Implementation Group requirements (extracted from the original text) and further additional requirements obtained during period 2 of MACC-II.,,,,,,0,,,,
This version of the User Requirement Document contained for the first time a comprehensive and consistently structured collection of all user requirements underlying the MACC services.,,,,,,0,,,,
Issues (v6.1 - 6.3) add additional requirements and feedback from the service providers obtained during the short period of MACC-III (focused on data access and user interaction towards the operational phase) and updates the responses from the MACC-III team analysed until 6/2015.,,,,,,1,,,,
It thus includes the documentation of user requirements collected during the MACC series of projects.,,,,,,1,,,,
To ease implementation in the various services a re- ordering of user requirements was conducted to group the requirements by service where appropriate, some erroneous categorization of requirements as data policy was corrected (maintaining the original numbering).,,,,,,1,,,
"User requirements were obtained by all means of user interaction (questionnaire, bi-lateral interaction, user workshops, user advisory board, analysis of relevant GEMS projects and further applicable documents from e.g. PASODOBLE and PROMOTE, online user feedback system).",,,,,,0,,,,
The initial formulation of user needs for the MACC project was initiated by the Implementation Group (IG) of the GMES Atmosphere Core Service (GACS).,,,,,,0,,,,
Consequently the initially formulated needs and requirements as expressed in the final report of the GACS IG from April 2009 build the backbone of the MACC user requirements.,,,,,,0,,,,
Consequently they are also included in the MACC User Requirements Document.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Specifically the chapters parameters for air quality, climate forcing, O3/UV, renewable energies), 5.1 (Functionality) as well as Annex 3 (Detailed outputs) have been evaluated and integrated into the MACC user requirements.",,,,,,0,,,,
Additional user requirements were collected during MACC and MACC-II and all user requirements were now numbered and tabulated to assure traceable responses to them.,,,,,,1,,,,
Several further user requirements were obtained during the short period of MACC-III (more in the light of the transition to the operational phase and user involvement).,,,,,,1,,,,
In this analysis the granularity of requirements is kept as they were raised from the originator (so often one requirement includes several sub elements) – this allows an easier matching to concrete services than splitting requirements to a very detailed level (which significantly increases their numbers).,,,,,,1,,,,
"All together the user requirements document contains now 288 numbered requirements: 188 technical, 44 regarding data access, 6 concerned with data policy and 50 for the newly added category user involvement.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The following lists of requirements separately listed for four sections (technical, data policy, data access, user involvement) serves as baseline to derive formalized service specifications and trace requirements back to the originating user (group).",,,,,,1,,,,
"It should be d that some requirements were erroneously categorized as “data policy” – these were now associated to their correct categories (“technical” or “data access”), but for the sake of traceability their original numbering was maintained, adding the new category tag in front, such as “T(DP)xxx”.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The requirements for the domains of air quality (AQ), climate forcing (CF), actually need very similar data, e.g. chemical composition, emissions, deposition fluxes, but for different purposes.",,,,,,1,,,,
Also the requirements for stratospheric ozone and UV services as well as solar radiation are overlapping with the former ones.,,,,,,0,,,,
"So the requirements listed here for various parameters (e.g. reactive trace gases or aerosols, Tab.",,,,,,0,,,,
The update of the URD to version v6.1 adds latest feedback from the sub projects and their users including an update of the last column in the requirements tables 8responses on the MACC-III team).,,,,,,0,,,,
The requirements numbering obeys the following pattern in each group of requirements (Tab.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Within each group the requirements are sorted related on their topic, not chronologically.",,,,,,0,,,,
"For each user requirement the following tables (1, 6, 7, 8) contain the requirement description, the targeted service(s), the originator and the implementation status / comment from service providers.",,,,,,0,,,,
It should be d that user requirements received lately (e.g. during the second user workshop in June 2014) are under investigation (to be continued in MACC- III as part of routine operations) and therefore no further response is yet stated in the last column for them.,,,,,,1,,,,
For the origin of user requirements the following acronyms are used in the tables: Online user feedback system.,,,,,,0,,,,
Good availability and connectivity (e.g. maintained.,,,,,,0,,,,
MACC air quality forecasts and analyses will serve as boundary conditions for further nesting activities of local and urban scale models.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Furthermore, an emission inventory for use in PASODOBLE will be provided by MACC as well as additional parameters that were derived within PROMOTE at European scale, like forecasts of UV or satellite based aerosol products.",,,,,,1,,,,
"As learned from PROMOTE experience, it is important to keep a maximum of information in emission inventory species concentrations (e.g. components of PM2.5 rather than the bulk concentration).",,,,,,0,,,,
Moreover ECMWF fields (analysis and forecast) should be provided by MACC.,,,,,,0,,,,
The PASODOBLE Airsheds have been re-defined at the IC_AIRSHEDS Splinter Meeting held along the PASODOBLE Kick-Off Meeting (21.-23.06.2010).,,,,,,0,,,,
It is important that these areas are covered by MACC European services.,,,,,,0,,,,
The following MACC data products are required by PASODOBLE during the development and delivery of the PASODOBLE services.,,,,,,1,,,,
"A timely, adequate and routinely delivery for the defined products is required, preferably two times daily (00:00 and 12:00).",,,,,,1,,,,
"At least by one PASODOBLE partner (VITO), a ftp-push system would be preferred for data access.",,,,,,0,,,,
"G-STEP will use EU/ESA GMES data and programmes, supplied from satellite, aerial and ground based observations along with data from the wider R&D base to advance business innovation and competitiveness.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The following MACC data products are required by G-STEP for demonstrating applications of space data and for encouraging the supply of local forecast information to relevant groups (e.g. health organizations), and for supplying information to environmental consultants.",,,,,,1,,,,
G-STEP relies on timely routine delivery of MACC core services with easy access to data for supporting operational delivery of public information.,,,,,,0,,,,
ENDORSE as GMES downstream project for energy needs from MACC-II solar irradiance time series with best possible accuracy.,,,,,,0,,,,
"It is important to represent the statistical distribution of irradiance values well, so that the assessment of solar energy applications is based on good coverage of background and extreme values.",,,,,,1,,,,
Time series need to be based on long enough periods (10-20 years) to allow coverage of typical and extreme years.,,,,,,0,,,,
Access to the time series at selected locations needs to be provided and needs to be facilitated by up-to-date technical interfaces (web services).,,,,,,0,,,,
"For services of this kind to be helpful, they must be consistent with existent European policy structure (e.g. EU Clean Air For Europe (CAFE), Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution).",,,,,,1,,,,
"Through the research GEMS and PROMOTE projects, significant efforts have been laid down in making data from national environmental agencies and research networks available in a suitable format and timely delivered.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The ambition has been to assimilate such surface observations into operational modeling systems in order to improve analysis and forecast of AQ, and to use NRT data for NRT evaluation of model performances.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Up to now, the NRT AQ data are mainly used for verification of model output in the GEMS and PROMOTE projects.",,,,,,0,,,,
"This page is showing partly the same information as the EEA ozone web, but there is data from different countries/regions in the two systems.",,,,,,0,,,,
Best would be the systems would merge into one common environment holding all data.,,,,,,0,,,,
"In MACC, NRT data is to be used not only for validation but for data assimilation, that is, to produce better air quality forecast and analysis over Europe and the globe.",,,,,,1,,,,
Input in the aerosol forcing processing tool (developed by Met Office Hadley Centre and ICARE offers a comparison tool of MACC data to satellite data through a web interface.,,,,,,0,,,,
Browse images made available to the public and data only to registered users.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The use will relate to specify boundary conditions, to assimilate MACC 3D dust objective analysis based on MODIS data as well as to use MACC dust products for validating/inter-comparing regional forecasts.",,,,,,0,,,,
Experimental dust assimilation in a regional model using daily MACC dust analysis done by a SDS-WAS partner indicates possible benefits.,,,,,,0,,,,
"MACC products, with access to the largest set of variables possible.",,,,,,0,,,,
Improvement of TNO/GEMS NOx inventory necessary with respect to overshooting NOx emissions in large cities.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Switzerland at the northern border of the Po Valley, while good agreement was found north of the Alps.",,,,,,0,,,,
This points to an underestimation of NOx sources in the Po Valley.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Additionally, the data will serve as input for research projects.",,,,,,0,,,,
Products (and results) need to be proven by peer reviewed articles.,,,,,,1,,,,
Documentation on data and correction history is needed.,,,,,,0,,,,
It is important that users can have access to the data that is used for PROMOTE or GEMS services.,,,,,,0,,,,
This data can then be used by the user for user specific tasks (e.g. for nesting procedures).,,,,,,1,,,,
As already mentioned during the evaluation of the PROMOTE services it should be interesting to produce daily validation graphs for the air quality forecasts for day-1 and the measurements from day-1 fo the representative measuring locations.,,,,,,0,,,,
"A number of meetings (user workshops, user advisory board meetings, summer school) led to valuable interaction among users, user feedback and user requirements.",,,,,,0,,,,
For each meeting a dedicated report is available together with the respective presentations.,,,,,,1,,,,
"At the first MACC-II user workshop (held jointly with GMES-PURE project, which is analysing the long-term requirements of the atmosphere service and needed satellite input data) a lively dialogue with about 30 users was achieved.",,,,,,0,,,,
Presentations of the service offering of MACC-II and of a wide range of example use cases (from scientific studies to downstream services and market introduction) demonstrated possible usage to new users (some are shown in brief in section 3) and triggered the discussion.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Main items of the discussion ranked around the need and possible way forward to estimate and display uncertainties in an appropriate way to users (overall, simple, event-specific).",,,,,,0,,,,
"Furthermore, the future evolution (existing gaps and possible improvements) and the perimeter of the service scope (e.g. national specific plots) were questioned.",,,,,,0,,,,
"One important finding was that there needs to be a borderline of MACC-II service scope to allow small industries to work on the focused (regional, topical) post-processing, while those small businesses are ready to adapt to the evolving service delivery of Copernicus Atmosphere as long as its long-term sustainability is assured.",,,,,,1,,,,
Regarding data access the user workshop clearly supported a simple registration procedure but no further complicated agreement mechanism, it was suggested that the access rules should be harmonized across all Copernicus services.,,,,,,0,,,
"Also service change / outage notifications were recommended, which were implemented afterwards.",,,,,,0,,,,
A wish for further information on current users and their usage was expressed (e.g. this report provides such a collection).,,,,,,0,,,,
"An evolution of data access technology (INSPIRE, WIS) was recommended (as implemented by MACC-II in 2014).",,,,,,0,,,,
"Dedicated working groups discussed in more detail the products and services for air quality, atmospheric composition, emissions, and solar energy.",,,,,,0,,,,
"These working groups identified in each topic the added value provided by MACC-II, required new products / parameters (covered in the user requirements document update) and possible usage barriers (e.g. data access).",,,,,,0,,,,
"The second user workshop followed a similar format as the first one, but was held in a different member state.",,,,,,0,,,,
"In addition an outlook to the operational Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) until 2020 could be presented, since the Copernicus regulation had been approved recently.",,,,,,0,,,,
A dedicated set of questions (focusing on the needs related to operations) was brought to the attention of the ~25 users.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Questions raised targeted the evolution of input data and modelling technology, data access rules and the governance of Copernicus with its user involvement.",,,,,,0,,,,
A focus was placed on the best interaction between Copernicus and national actors who may wish to build their services on input from Copernicus (e.g. air quality modelling chain).,,,,,,0,,,,
"Representatives of national authorities expressed the required constraints for using MACC-II services: stability, continuity and sustainability of the service; if there are changes to the service then these must be very clearly documented to remove the possibility of non-existent trends being identified when in fact the ‘trend’ is due to a model upgrade for example.",,,,,,1,,,,
Several clear needs were expressed for further evolution of the service offering (e.g. consistency between daily products and long-term re-analysis and clear documentation of service changes), those requirements were again included into the recent User Requirements Document update.,,,,,,1,,,
"A first dedicated policy user workshop was held in at the premises of the European Research Executive Agency, where MACC-II explained its policy-related services and products and exposed them to discussion and feedback to a group of national and regional policy actors.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Those authorities named as their needed Copernicus policy services consultancy, scenarios / sensitivity studies and support in reviews; in many cases this would require on demand support possibly based on underlying routine processing of European data / models.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Required services include source apportionment, future scenarios along regulatory scenarios.",,,,,,0,,,,
MACC-II policy toolboxes should allow users to define online their scenarios.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Continued cooperation with European policy actors (EEA, DG-ENV, JRC) and related international activities (WMO, WHO, UNEP) was recommended.",,,,,,0,,,,
It was required to improve the robustness of services and documentation of uncertainties.,,,,,,0,,,,
The representativeness of MACC-II datasets for regional / local observations was discussed.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The MACC-II European air quality assessment reports were discussed and it was recommended to assess and document the consistency with the report (using the same name) published by EEA; furthermore the need for an advanced assessment report using only non-validated ground-based data was expressed, so that the annual MACC-II report comes timely for its utilization in the national reporting obligations.",,,,,,1,,,,
Requirements expressed during this workshop were also analysed in the User Requirements Document update.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Based on discussions at the 2nd MACC-II user workshop preceding the UAB meeting, members of the UAB made took some of those discussion items to concrete recommendations.",,,,,,1,,,,
A major discussion point was how the MACC-II regional ensemble forecasts can be of best use to national / regional downstream services so that duplicated efforts for global / European modelling can be reduced.,,,,,,1,,,,
A working group shall be initiated to iterate this issue between national representatives and the MACC-II ENS service and recommend a practical solution based on proven common needs of various users and documented impact of proposed output extensions.,,,,,,0,,,,
"In addition, tools as they have been recently implemented for selection of parts of the service output (e.g. within OGC web services) can be helpful.",,,,,,0,,,,
The UAB discussed in how far metadata on service quality / degradation (e.g. a missing particular satellite) can be introduced.,,,,,,0,,,,
"However, it became clear that further development work and discussion is needed (e.g. on the granularity and severity of such degradation points for well documented major impact) before this is mature for introduction into the service.",,,,,,1,,,,
The UAB regarded good communication on service updates and relevant meetings (e.g. user workshops) as important and recommended to re-initiate (as in MACC) issuing newsletters with general information, these newsletter should be published on a case-driven basis (a first one was published shortly after the UAB meeting).,,,,,,1,,,
Regarding training the UAB recognized the need for a general introduction to new users on the MACC-II website (e.g. in the form of a practical guide how to access the MACC-II products).,,,,,,0,,,,
"At the end of its first formal MACC-II meeting the user Advisory Board discussed the governance for the future Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service and recommended that the Service should continue to involve its own (topic-focused) User Advisory Board but at the same time the Commission should take care of a good communication between Service-internal user consultation, the Copernicus overall User Forum and the national user communities / formal representation for Copernicus.",,,,,,1,,,,
"During the MACC-II summer school in June 2013 the 62 participants contributed to user feedback within several dedicated working groups who analysed different parts of the MACC-II website, detected several errors and weaknesses and made recommendations to improve the information.",,,,,,1,,,,
Overarching the need for a section with frequently asked questions (FAQ) was raised in order to support new users’ entry to accessing the products and services of AMCC-II.,,,,,,0,,,,
Acknowledging the constraint of easy maintainability those FAQ could be linked from the catalogue selections when a user has chosen the relevant service / product or they could be accessed via a general “cloud of clickable key words”.,,,,,,1,,,,
"These FAQ could cover topics such as general atmospheric science background, general MACC-II services overview, technical information (methods used, input and output data, validation overview.",,,,,,0,,,,
These recommendations and further detailed findings of the summer school working groups shall be analysed and a FAQ concept for implementation in the operational Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service worked out during the MACC-III project (8/2014 – 3/2015).,,,,,,1,,,,
"The second meeting of the User Advisory Board (UAB) was held by telephone conference, hosted by ECMWF on 25 November 2014.",,,,,,0,,,,
The UAB expressed the request for an uninterrupted service continuity and for informative communication to users about any changes occurring.,,,,,,1,,,,
The UAB was informed on preparations of a workshop (to be held 7 January 2015) to explore the best response to the user need for more complete chemical suite of species as output from the ensemble service.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Finally, the UAB discussed the set of user documentation available from MACC-II (and to be updated in MACC-III): user requirements document, user queries summary, user feedback summary, metadata and technical web service interface descriptions.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The UAB requested better accessibility to the user requirements documentation (including feedback on implementation response status) and to the user feedback summary (including use cases), either online or by better positioning on the website.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Furthermore, the UAB suggested converting the user questionnaire available at the MACC website into an online tool for easier access.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Finally, the UAB discussed the future process for prioritizing user requirements during the operational Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service phase.",,,,,,1,,,,
The UAB can provide valuable consultation in this process within the service.,,,,,,0,,,,
At the current stage the consideration was raised whether for each requirement a number of users making this request should be added to guide prioritizing.,,,,,,1,,,,
"However, it was also stated, that requirements by “power users” (e.g. EC directorates or large commercial entities) who request large data amounts or provide their downstream services to large audiences could be prioritized as well.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The MACC-III Policy User workshop took place in Vienna on 3-4 March 2015 and gathered 29 product providers, users and potential users from 13 European countries.",,,,,,0,,,,
The workshop focused on downstream users who make use of MACC-III data for policy support.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Most participants had already gained some experience in using MACC-III products, such as the TNO-MACC emission data, the MACC global model or regional ensemble output for chemical boundary conditions, and the air pollution forecasts (in particular during episodes).",,,,,,0,,,,
"These products are used in support of policy decisions, for alerting, and to get a better understanding of the origins of pollution.",,,,,,1,,,,
"During the workshop, use cases were presented, and news about policy-relevant products of MACC-III were provided.",,,,,,1,,,,
The second day of the workshop was dedicated entirely to user-provider interaction.,,,,,,0,,,,
During a series of training sessions the audience received a more detailed introduction about where to find MACC-III products and how to use and interpret the data and graphs.,,,,,,1,,,,
The different roundtable discussions of the final session gave all participants the opportunity to provide their feedback and to make suggestions for MACC-III product refinements as well as new products.,,,,,,1,,,,
"During and after the workshop the product providers of MACC-III received very useful comments from representatives from nine different countries, users that will be able to set the path for the information which their national policy officers will require.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Among the main requests from the users were the timeliness of the products, the tailoring of products to specific regions and to simplify access to products and/or make them easier to find and to download on the MACC website.",,,,,,0,,,,
"In terms of documentation, more metadata in air pollution data files was requested.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The MACC-III User Workshop was held on 11 May 2015 in Rome, co-organized by ISPRA, Italy.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The workshop provided an overview of MACC-III services and user support, a number of user case studies demonstrating the use of MACC-III products outside Italy and presentations on potential use cases in Italy with their associated needs.",,,,,,0,,,,
A focus topic of the user workshop was the use of MACC-III boundary conditions.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The interaction during the workshop has large potential to stimulate extended use of MACC-III products in Italy, but requires further coordination of different actors in this country.",,,,,,1,,,,
The smaller number of attendees from other countries could also benefit from the interaction between users, the model of co-organizing the user workshop with a national Copernicus forum was considered very promising by other national representatives.,,,,,,0,,,
The final UAB telecon in MACC-III was held on 22 May 2015.,,,,,,0,,,,
UAB members discussed best possible means of assuring to obtain user feedback.,,,,,,0,,,,
Suggestions were made to clean up annually the user lists by requesting a renewal of user registrations combined with an obligatory answering of a small feedback questionnaire.,,,,,,0,,,,
Such a renewal would require repeated prior notice by e-mail to avoid user frustration.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Furthermore, different user types (occasional science users, high frequency operational users)) need to be treated differently.",,,,,,0,,,,
As a second item the UAB discussed the future role of an UAB in the CAMS service.,,,,,,0,,,,
All members agreed that a UAB allows more detailed discussions of critical items than possible in a larger user workshop.,,,,,,1,,,,
It was also stated that the Copernicus User Forum based on national representation is too remote from the individual services.,,,,,,0,,,,
For both reasons it was concluded that a UAB within the CAMS service would be worthwhile also in the future.,,,,,,0,,,,

"Under the guidance of processes provided by Crew Transportation Plan (CCT-PLN-1100), this document with its sister documents, Crew Transportation Technical Management Processes (CCT- PLN-1120), Crew Transportation Technical Standards and Design Evaluation Criteria (CCT-STD- Station (ISS) to Commercial Orbital Transportation Services Interface Requirements Document (SSP for services to the ISS for the Commercial Provider.",,,,,,0,,,,
"When NASA Crew Transportation System (CTS) certification is achieved for ISS transportation, the Commercial Provider will be eligible to provide services to and from the ISS during the services phase of the NASA Commercial Crew Program (CCP).",,,,,,1,,,,
The CTS has two top-level objectives in support of the NASA mission of providing services to the ISS.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The primary objectives are to provide for crew rotation capability for four NASA or NASA-sponsored crewmembers, henceforth called NASA crew, and to provide for an emergency crew return capability for these crewmembers at any time while the commercial spacecraft is docked to the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Secondary objectives include transporting a limited amount of ISS Program-specified pressurized cargo to the ISS, returning pressurized cargo from the ISS, and providing for a crew safe haven capability when the spacecraft is docked to the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
The Design Reference Mission (DRM) for ISS can also be found in CCT-DRM-1110.,,,,,,0,,,,
The spacecraft will be capable of transporting NASA crew to the ISS and docking 24 hours after launch.,,,,,,1,,,,
Mission launch opportunities must be accomplished within NASA-specified timeframes to accommodate ongoing ISS science operations and to minimize ISS traffic model impacts associated with other visiting vehicles.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Prior to launch, the CTS supports a NASA-provided pre-launch health stabilization program for NASA crew.",,,,,,0,,,,
The CTS also assures comparable health stabilization for any other crewmembers.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Within a few hours of launch, NASA completes their crew medical assessments and baseline data collection process in NASA-provided facilities and hands the crew over to the CTS provider for transportation to the launch site.",,,,,,1,,,,
The NASA flight surgeons will serve as the physicians for the NASA crew during all phases of flight.,,,,,,1,,,,
Lift-off occurs when the launch site passes through the ISS’s orbital plane.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Daily launch opportunities then depend on the resulting phasing; an everyday launch opportunity is desirable, but not required.",,,,,,1,,,,
Launch and ascent into the 51.6 degree inclination must meet Range Safety constraints associated with the launch site.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Following ascent, an orbital insertion maneuver is executed and becomes the first of several orbital rendezvous maneuvers to be performed.",,,,,,1,,,,
These maneuvers bring the spacecraft closer towards the ISS.,,,,,,1,,,,
ISS standard communications are used when the spacecraft closes to within tens of kilometers to the ISS and ship-to-ship voice communications are established.,,,,,,1,,,,
Relative navigation is performed by the spacecraft using available cooperative and non-cooperative assets on the ISS.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Communication and telemetry monitoring will be shared between the Commercial Vehicle Control Center (CVCC) and the ISS mission control facilities, Mission Control Center - Houston (MCC-H).",,,,,,0,,,,
"MCC-H Mission Authority will be established to ensure ISS, spacecraft, and crew safety.",,,,,,1,,,,
"When in close proximity to the ISS, after receiving approval from both the spacecraft and MCC-H, the spacecraft begins a final approach to a NASA-specified docking port on the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
"After docking, the vestibule between the ISS and the spacecraft is pressurized and verified not to be leaking.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The spacecraft hatches are opened and the crew transfers into the ISS, placing the newly arrived spacecraft in a quiescent state.",,,,,,0,,,,
"If the nominal docking attempt is not successful, or if an anomaly occurs near docking which would prevent docking at the nominal opportunity, the spacecraft backs out to a short safe distance and performs necessary reconfigurations, followed by a second approach and docking attempt.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If that docking is also unsuccessful, the spacecraft will separate from the ISS vicinity on a collision-free safe trajectory and the spacecraft will prepare for a final re-rendezvous and docking attempt on the following crew day.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If this final docking attempt is unsuccessful, the mission will be terminated, and the crew will return to Earth.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Because of the short time duration from launch to docking, internal maintenance of the spacecraft should not be necessary, nor should the crew require certain complex habitability items for food and waste management that can be found on longer duration vehicles, like the Space Shuttle or the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
Extravehicular Activity (EVA) will not occur because the complexity of preparing for and executing an EVA is precluded due to the short time in the spacecraft early in the mission.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Similarly, EVA will not be performed during the short free-flight duration from undocking to landing.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The spacecraft will be designed to be attached to the ISS for 210 days, although nominal crew rotations will occur at approximately 180-day intervals.",,,,,,0,,,,
The spacecraft remains quiescent and requires minimal maintenance during docked operations.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The CVCC will provide routine, periodic support for these docked operations, in association with MCC-H.",,,,,,0,,,,
The ISS will provide power and environmental resources to the spacecraft in order to maintain the vehicle in a return-to-Earth ready state.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Due to limitations in the number of docking ports on the ISS, the spacecraft may need to be relocated from one docking port to another during ISS increment operations to provide operational flexibility.",,,,,,1,,,,
"To accomplish this relocation, the spacecraft’s full crew complement will ingress the spacecraft, close the hatch, and the spacecraft will be relocated from one port to the other port.",,,,,,1,,,,
The crew needs to be in the spacecraft to protect from the potential failure to re-mate with a docking port and preserve assured return for the crew.,,,,,,0,,,,
"When docked to the ISS, the spacecraft also provides a contingency “safe haven” capability allowing the crew to retreat to the spacecraft, close the hatch, and remain in a safe environment for up to 24 hours.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If necessary, the spacecraft atmosphere will be purged during this activity.",,,,,,1,,,,
The ISS will provide attitude control during this 24-hour period.,,,,,,1,,,,
"After the ISS returns to a habitable environment state, the crew will open the hatch and re-enter the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If the ISS cannot achieve a habitable state during this period, the crew will return to Earth.",,,,,,1,,,,
"While docked to the ISS, the spacecraft will also serve as an emergency return vehicle for contingencies requiring the return of the crew brought to the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Emergencies could result from ISS system failures, an uninhabitable crew environment, or a medical event requiring the return of the crewmembers.",,,,,,1,,,,
The crew will return to Earth within 24 hours of a declaration of an intention to return early.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The crew will be fully trained to execute these contingency return-to-Earth operations, landing at a location where rescue is likely to be most expedient.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Due to the limited size and power available, the spacecraft is expected to have basic first aid and life support capability to respond to immediate medical conditions in the free-flight mode.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If the Commercial Provider has received NASA approval to fly non-NASA crew to the ISS, the spacecraft will need to provide food, water, clothing, Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) consumables, and other logistics for these crewmembers for the docked timeframe, since NASA does not generally pre-position these supplies on the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
"After handover is complete, the current increment crew will return in the spacecraft.",,,,,,1,,,,
"They will enter the spacecraft, perform a vehicle health check, close hatches, depress the vestibule, perform a hatch leak check to verify seal integrity, and depart from the ISS.",,,,,,0,,,,
"When available consumables permit, the spacecraft will potentially circumnavigate the ISS while in proximity to assess the external configuration of the ISS prior to final departure.",,,,,,1,,,,
"During this circumnavigation, the crew will capture imagery to allow post-flight analysis of the ISS configuration.",,,,,,1,,,,
The timeframe from undocking through landing is envisioned to be a short 4 to 8 hour free-flight duration.,,,,,,0,,,,
Landing will occur on the continental United States (U.S.) land mass or waters directly extending from the coast for nominal landing.,,,,,,0,,,,
"This reduces risk by minimizing rescue force assets, increasing proximity to U.S. medical facilities, increasing security, and ensuring a prepared landing site free of hazards.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If the nominal deorbit maneuver is waived-off after separation from the ISS, a subsequent landing at an alternate landing site, with nearby recovery forces, will be possible.",,,,,,1,,,,
The spacecraft may also perform orbital maneuvers in low Earth orbit (LEO) to better accommodate alternate landing sites.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Returning crew will be deconditioned and potentially have impaired musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary, and neurovestibular capabilities as a result of long duration exposure to the micro-gravity and space environment, resulting in degraded crewmember performance in the post- landing timeframe.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Because of the deconditioned state of the crew, special considerations need to be provided for crew recovery, medical care, and other post-landing care activities.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Upon arrival at the landing location, the NASA crew will be met with a recovery crew that will assist the astronauts in egress operations and removal of time-critical cargo.",,,,,,1,,,,
NASA personnel will begin post- flight medical and science evaluations soon after egress is complete in a temporary facility at the landing location.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Subsequently, the NASA flight crew, NASA support personnel, and time-critical cargo will be transported by a CTS element to a staging location where handover will be completed and the NASA crew and cargo will be flown back to Houston using NASA assets.",,,,,,0,,,,
"After recovery operations are complete, the spacecraft will be safed and transported to a location for subsequent post-flight evaluation.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The purpose of this document, hereafter referred to as CCT-REQ-1130, is to provide the requirements for development (design, manufacturing, testing, qualification, production, and operation) of commercial services to deliver NASA crew and limited cargo to and from the ISS.",,,,,,0,,,,

The CTS shall be capable of at least two crewed launches to the ISS per year.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Rationale: A normal ISS increment is 180 days, requiring a new replacement crew to be launched approximately two times per year.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The CTS shall simultaneously operate two spacecraft, to allow an ISS NASA crew handover.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The launch of the next rotation mission may occur prior to the departure of the current increment crew working on the ISS, resulting in a direct crew handover period where two commercial spacecraft would be docked to the ISS for approximately 7 to 10 days.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The communication infrastructure in the spacecraft, CVCC, network, and other required assets must be sized to accommodate two operational spacecraft (one docked and one in free-flight mode or both docked).",,,,,,0,,,,
Rationale: ISS crew time is reserved for science and other operations.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The spacecraft design should not require commanding, active monitoring, and maintenance during quiescent docked operations to avoid impacts to the ISS crew science productivity.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Additionally, this will reduce the overall burden on the ground infrastructure required to support this spacecraft while docked to the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
Periodic vehicle maintenance with a maximum crew impact is defined in requirement 3.8.3.1.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The CTS shall complete the mission without requiring an EVA for nominal operations, contingency operations, or to perform maintenance activity.",,,,,,1,,,,
Rationale: EVA will not occur because of the short time in the spacecraft early in the mission when the complexity of preparing for and executing an EVA precludes that activity.,,,,,,1,,,,
"EVAs during the docked timeframe impact ISS crew time, consumables, and on-going science activities.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Finally, the timeframe at the end of the flight is envisioned to be a short free-flight duration from undocking to landing, which precludes EVA.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: Unless specifically d in requirement 3.1.1.6 or SSP 50808, the CTS must provide all the supplies necessary for space flight to meet the functions described in CCT- REQ-1130.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The spacecraft shall accommodate and utilize the NASA-provided supplies for NASA crew to include the following items: Environmental Health Kit, Food and Utensils, Contamination Cleanup Kit, Passive Radiation Area Monitors, Crew Personal Dosimeters, Medical Kit, ISS Medical Accessory Kit (IMAK), Crew Worn-On Items, and ISS Crew Provisions.",,,,,,0,,,,
The spacecraft shall accommodate a total of 85 kg (187 lbs) of NASA-provided supplies.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Rationale: NASA has determined that certain items, such as food, clothing, personal dosimeters, a medical kit, and an environmental kit, will be provided to the NASA crew since many of these items will be the same product that they will use on their 180 day stay on the ISS.",,,,,,0,,,,
A notional list of NASA-provided supplies for NASA crew with mass and volumes can be found in Appendix J for reference.,,,,,,0,,,,
Some items in the NASA-provided supplies are driven by the operational timelines and contingency days.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The base value for food was chosen in accordance with the notional timeline in Appendix P. For mission durations greater than this, additional food would be required.",,,,,,0,,,,
"It is easier for the crew to have the same individual item and familiarity and training with the common items (e.g., Medical Kit) during both the free-flight and docked portions of the mission.",,,,,,1,,,,
"For these items, the spacecraft must provide the appropriate stowage and interfaces to properly store the equipment prior to use.",,,,,,0,,,,
These items are not cargo or payload and are in addition to the 100 kg of cargo called out in requirement 3.1.3.1.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The CTS shall provide habitable consumables, such as food, water, clothing, oxygen, nitrogen, CO2 removal, personal hygiene, and other required consumables, for non-NASA crew during the docked portion of the mission when the non-NASA crewmembers are on the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: For any mission model that requires additional crew beyond the 4 NASA crew required for the ISS increment, the CTS will be responsible for carrying the required logistics in the spacecraft to support the additional crewmembers during docked timeframe.",,,,,,1,,,,
"NASA will not have the ability to pre-position supplies on ISS via another cargo launch vehicle due to the required ISS logistics support via Cargo Resupply Contract (CRS), Progress, and Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV)/H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) vehicles.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Thus, the CTS will be responsible for providing food, water, clothing, and other logistics for non-NASA crew.",,,,,,1,,,,
The nitrogen only needs to be provided if any equipment or operation to support the non-NASA crew is venting air overboard as part of its nominal operation.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The CTS shall accommodate 1, 2, 3, and 4 NASA crewmembers during a single mission.",,,,,,1,,,,
Rationale: Four NASA crew are required to be transported and returned to the ISS during a single mission to meet the United States Operations Segment (USOS) demand for crew time based on full utilization of the ISS to perform science and support the ISS National Laboratory Program.,,,,,,1,,,,
"All docking and undocking operations are a significant impact to the completion of ISS science, resulting in the determination by the ISS Program that the most efficient crew rotations strategy is to launch and return 4 crewmembers on a single vehicle.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Additionally, the CTS must be able to perform the mission with crew complements of 1, 2, 3, or 4 crewmembers in a single launch or landing to provide flexibility in the ISS crew rotation plan.",,,,,,1,,,,
Rationale: NASA crew are required to be transported to the ISS to meet the United States Operations Segment (USOS) demand for crew time based on full utilization of the ISS to perform science and support the ISS National Laboratory Program.,,,,,,0,,,,
Rationale: NASA crew are required to be returned from the ISS to meet the United States Operations Segment (USOS) demand for crew time based on full utilization of the ISS to perform science and support the ISS National Laboratory Program.,,,,,,0,,,,
The ISS requires continuous presence of the spacecraft to support sustained operations.,,,,,,1,,,,
The 210 days provides 30 days of contingency on the nominal 180 day turnaround.,,,,,,0,,,,
The nominal crew rotation will occur at approximately 180 days based on the ISS human research program medical data collection needs.,,,,,,1,,,,
It is possible for this rotation to be altered by one month (earlier or later) in order to accommodate other overall ISS Program requirements or anomaly resolution/response.,,,,,,1,,,,
The CTS shall launch from a U.S. (or U. S. State Department approved) launch site(s).,,,,,,0,,,,
"Rationale: Launching from a designated U.S. (or U.S. State Department approved) launch sites reduces risk by minimizing necessary abort recovery force assets, increasing proximity to U.S. medical facilities, increasing security, and ensuring a prepared launch and emergency landing site, which minimizes unknown hazards and potential security issues.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: Returning to a designated continental U.S. landing site or waters directly extending from the coast reduces risk by minimizing necessary recovery force assets, increasing proximity to U.S. medical facilities, increasing security, and ensuring a prepared landing site free of hazards.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Deconditioned crewmembers have impaired musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary, and neurovestibular capabilities as a result of long duration exposure to the micro-gravity and space environment, resulting in degraded crewmember performance in the post-landing timeframe.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Because of the deconditioned state of the crew, special considerations need to be provided for medical and other post-landing care.",,,,,,1,,,,
"This cargo includes any NASA items (ISS maintenance hardware, powered payloads, etc.",,,,,,0,,,,
These items required for crew sustenance and operations of the spacecraft will be provided by the CTS and will be allocated mass and volume in addition to cargo goals defined below.,,,,,,1,,,,
The spacecraft shall accommodate 100 kg (220.5 lbm) of soft stowage cargo in the pressurized volume during a single mission.,,,,,,1,,,,
The spacecraft shall provide a contiguous volume with the dimensions 0.468 m x 0.556 m x accommodate time critical cargo.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The 100 kg, 0.227 cubic meter cargo requirement is sized to transport a small amount of ISS Program-specified cargo inside the spacecraft to be transferred to the ISS upon arrival.",,,,,,0,,,,
The cargo will be contained in either a standard set of ISS soft stowage cargo to easily accommodate transfer by the crew onorbit.,,,,,,1,,,,
The dimensions of 0.468 m x 0.556 m x equivalent to a double-middeck locker and was chosen such that it would be a candidate location for the hard mounted cargo swap required by requirement 3.1.3.5.,,,,,,0,,,,
The cargo in this volume (whether hard mounted or soft stowage) must be accessible as time-critical cargo.,,,,,,0,,,,
Maximum flexibility in configuring the cargo items is important since failures of hardware components on the ISS will be a factor in the cargo items manifested on a given CTS mission.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The spacecraft shall accommodate an additional 100 kg (220.5 lbm) of soft stowage cargo in lieu of a NASA crewmember during a single mission per requirements in SSP 50833, Section 3.1.2, except for Triple CTB's in section 3.1.2.1 and all M-Bags in section 3.1.2.2.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The transport of an additional 100 kg of soft stowage cargo in lieu of a NASA crewmember provides the capability to react to situations that dictate the timely delivery and return of ISS components, supplies, and science hardware due to operational needs of the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Obviously, maximum flexibility in the size, volume, and mass is important to accommodate a wide range of potential cargo.",,,,,,0,,,,
The concept proposed is that the seat would be removed to allow for a cargo pallet or other structure to be flown in its place in order to properly restrain the cargo.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The spacecraft shall accommodate hard mounted time-critical cargo consisting of either two powered single middeck lockers or one powered double middeck locker in the pressurized volume during a single mission, and maintain cargo services per requirements in SSP 50833, Section 3.1.1 while installed.",,,,,,1,,,,
The intent of this requirement is to allow for the transport of time-critical cargo in a powered middeck locker or lockers.,,,,,,0,,,,
"ISS power necessary for the locker(s) will be provided from docking until payload transfer in addition to, not in lieu of, all other power allocations specified herein or within SSP 50808, such as requirement 3.4.2.5, ISS Safe Haven or SSP the locker(s) are required in addition to, not in lieu of or included within, all other mass and volume requirements specified herein, i.e., the 100kg (220.5 lb) of pressurized cargo defined in requirements 3.1.3.1 and 3.1.3.5.",,,,,,1,,,,
The middeck locker(s) would be provided by the ISS Program either prior to launch or during onorbit operations to be transported to or from the ISS with a known quantity of science samples inside.,,,,,,1,,,,
"When the need arises, operational flexibility is required to allow the ISS Program to fly additional passive cargo within the mass and volume of the powered lockers.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The spacecraft shall accommodate additional time-critical hard mounted cargo consisting of either two powered single middeck lockers or one powered double middeck locker, during a single mission in lieu of the soft stowage cargo required by 3.1.3.1.",,,,,,1,,,,
The intent of this requirement is to allow for the transport of scientific samples in a powered middeck locker or lockers.,,,,,,0,,,,
"ISS power necessary for the locker(s) will be provided from docking until payload transfer in addition to, not in lieu of, all other power allocations specified herein or within SSP 50808, such as 3.4.2.5 ISS Safe Haven or SSP 50808, 3.2.2.4.1.3 Power Consumption.",,,,,,1,,,,
The middeck locker(s) would be provided by ISS either prior to launch or during onorbit operations to be transported to or from ISS with a known quantity of science samples inside.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The CTS shall maintain cargo services per SSP 50833, Sections 3.1.1 and install time-critical cargo within 24 hours of a scheduled launch.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: Once time-critical cargo has been handed over from the ISS program, it is critical that cargo services be maintained to ensure the integrity of the cargo.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Late cargo installation, within 24 hours of scheduled launch, is required to maintain the integrity of time-critical cargo.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The CTS may select the specific integration window, as long as it is within 24 hours of scheduled launch.",,,,,,1,,,,
This requirement addresses both soft stowage and hard mounted time-critical cargo.,,,,,,0,,,,
The time-critical cargo installation may include an Integrated Verification Test (IVT) to verify the interface between the spacecraft and the payload and must be completed within the L-24 window of opportunity.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Once installed, the CTS must maintain cargo services, if required, until the cargo is removed for transfer to the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
"In the event that a launch is scrubbed or delayed and rescheduled, access to remove and re-install the time-critical cargo would need to be provided as well.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The CTS shall remove ISS time-critical cargo from the spacecraft no later than 1 hour after crew egress, post-docking and post-landing at a supported landing site.",,,,,,1,,,,
Rationale: Early cargo access after spacecraft docking and landing is required to maintain the integrity of time-critical cargo.,,,,,,1,,,,
"On orbit, the ISS crew must perform post-docking procedures quickly such that the cargo transfer can also occur no later than one hour after crew egress from the spacecraft.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The CTS will provide the capability to retrieve time-critical cargo within 1 hour upon completion of crew egress after post-landing and post-docking, while also providing continuous cargo services, per SSP 50833.",,,,,,1,,,,
The ISS program requires the operational flexibility to best utilize crew time and manage the crew day.,,,,,,1,,,,
Mission priorities may preclude cargo transfer immediately following docking or prior to undocking requiring the spacecraft to maintain the specified environment and services until cargo transfer can be completed.,,,,,,1,,,,
"In these scenarios, the spacecraft will receive the necessary ISS resources, e.g. power and intermodule ventilation (IMV), to support this mode of operation.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The CTS shall have a launch probability not less than 80% for each launch opportunity, exclusive of external launch constraints and abort zone weather, for the time interval beginning with tanking and ending with the launch window close for that attempt.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The launch vehicle, spacecraft, and ground infrastructure must be designed to have a high launch probability once the vehicle is in the final stages of preparation for launch.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Each point at which the ISS is within the planar and phasing capabilities of the system is considered a launch opportunity; therefore, probability must be calculated throughout the year for these daily opportunities.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The timeframe begins with booster tanking on the launch day, which signals a commitment to launch on that day and ends when a launch is no longer possible due to performance limitations.",,,,,,1,,,,
