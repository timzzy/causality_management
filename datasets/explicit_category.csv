This means that the data is not being processed locally and it can also take some time before the processing is complete.,,0,,,,,,,,
This may result in significant uncertainty since the spectral signature at the coast is not invariant.,1,1,,,,,,,,
But this requires a long time series so that sufficient match-ups between images are available.,1,,,,,,,,,
"It is possible to create a composite image simply by normalising the image set using an image manipulation package but if the aim is to derive geophysical measurements care is needed to ensure inter-calibration considers the differing spectral response of the sensors, the observing and environmental conditions, and the spectral signature of the target.",1,,,,,,,,,
Implicitly that quantifying and correcting relative bias between monitored and reference sensors for collocated data can be generalised to measurements by the same pair of satellites even when they are not being directly compared.,1,,,,,,,,,
"By re-scaling all sensors to the same radiometric scale a consistent set of acquisitions over a given site, covering a broad range of geometries, is generated.",1,,,,,,,,,
Absolute calibration of images is probably out-of-scope considering the resources allocated to this tool (5 months) and the requirement for a reasonably long time series of Sentinel-2 data to ensure there are a significant number of matchup images sharing geometrical and temporal viewing and illumination characteristics.,0,,,,,,,,,
If there is a necessity for inter-calibration of SAR images input is required from another partner with the relevant knowledge.,1,1,,,,,,,,

Data will be subject to quality assurance prior to either initial or recurring uploading to STEWARDS.,,1,,,,,,,,
Initial population of STEWARDS will require that transition filters be developed jointly between the STEWARDS team and the individual watersheds.,,1,,,,,,,,
Quality assurance checking will be carried out at two different levels – local site level and central site level.,,1,,,,,,,,
Quality assurance checking at the local sites may be performed before or during the standard exchange file conversion phase.,,1,1,,,,,,,
"A general quality assurance checking, not as specific as at the local sites, will be carried out during the data uploading stage.",,1,1,,,,,,,
Watershed data to be used in modeling that does not conform to model requirements will be processed in STEWARDS for inclusion in the STEWARDS databases.,,1,1,,,,,,,
"As part of the initial population of the database, time-series data (measurement data, annual land use information, weather/climate data) that has been collected by local watershed staff will be processed through local and CEAP QA/QC procedures and uploaded to the STEWARDS database by watershed staff per obligations to CEAP Objective 1.",,1,,,,,,,,
"In this manner, all the data files from the local sites will have consistent formats when they are stored in the central site.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"The central database will allow users to access the data of individual watersheds, sub-watersheds on a station-by-station basis, or a collection of stations if the entire dataset is desired.",,1,1,,,,,,,

"This system will include a warning message when a low transmission speed is detected, and a non-graphical interface option will be available.",,1,1,,,,,,,

"In that case, the person would be referred to an alternate method of getting the data.",,0,1,,,,,,,
"Given that these data will also remain on the watershed site system, rather than expend resources to prevent this loss, such failures will be monitored and the uploading process will be repeated.",,1,,,,,,,,
Authentication addresses security requirements to ensure those using system are who they say they are.,,1,1,,,,,,,
This is of greatest concern when data are being changed or updated.,,1,1,,,,,,,
STEWARDS will use the user classes described in section 2.3 above to define boundaries of information sharing to ensure confidentiality as appropriate.,,1,1,,,,,,,
Any data that should be viewed by a restricted audience must be protected with appropriate security features.,,1,1,,,,,,,
"Therefore, extensive data validation and review will be performed both before data are uploaded to the system and as part of the upload process.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"The system will need policy and procedures protecting the data from intentional or unintentional modifications, and to ensure accurate data are made available.",,,1,,,,,,,
Functional requirements are also called behavioral requirements because they address what the system does.,,1,1,,,,,,,
"Portability - (1) A term used to describe an object that can be easily moved, such as a portable computer; (2) When referring to computer software, portability refers to how easy a software program can be moved between computer Operating Systems.",,1,,,,,,,,
These enhancements have been included to improve the capability of the program and to automate many of the input data preparation steps needed for use with large watershed systems.,,,1,,,,,,,
Completion/Confirmation messages should be displayed when the application processes the data successfully.,,1,1,,,,,,,
"Through a user case survey and a logical analysis of user’s expectations and system functionalities, the system components for STEWARDS are identified (Fig.",,1,,,,,,,,
System design provides a detailed description for each identified component and produces a physical data system design (with documentation) that allow the system developers to construct each component (layer) accordingly.,,,1,,,,,,,
"At the end of the system design phase, hardware, software tools and skill requirements, and other resources will be identified and a system developer team/plan will be drawn.",,,1,,,,,,,

"Where the word system is used, it will similarly refer to the SLCCI operational system, unless it is clear from the context that another system is being referred to.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"To this end, the System Requirements document (SRD) reasons for the apt adoption of certain requirements from an existing operational system, towards a measured realisation of an SLCCI system.",,0,1,,,,,,,
"The scope of the operational system from which the SLCCI system will be founded is therefore mature and well defined, given its proven validation over time in an operational context.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The CCI Statement of Work does not directly preclude inclusion of any type of environment, but does encourage reuse of existing similar operational systems, as practiced in Chapter 6 (Requirements Elicitation), which may therefore indirectly constrain the environment(s) which may be considered to those adopted by the existing similar system.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"To this end, acknowledgment and consideration is taken in the System Requirements Document (SRD) with the aim of exploring commonality between the SLCCI and other CCI projects.",,0,0,,,,,,,
"The lifecycle of the System Requirements Document (SRD) starts via a Preliminary System Analysis Document (PSAD) identifying the candidate system for reuse for SLCCI, namely DUACS.",,,1,,,,,,,
"A set of system requirements is elicited and refined based on a judicious mapping with DUACS, prior to other inputs being considered.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"As depicted by Figure 6-2, the steps undertaken during Requirements Elicitation start with the extraction of business goals from the Statement of Work, the axiomatic needs for the SLCCI project towards an operational system (Section 6.2).",,1,1,,,,,,,
"The pertinent business goal regarding system reuse is pursued through the identification and adoption of an apt system for re-use (Section 6.3); a line of argument is posited towards adoption of DUACS based on significant similarities, though also identifying differences for accountability of argument.",,,1,,,,,,,
The ESA Climate Change Initiative Statement of Work [RD 7] represents the source from which the business goals of the system are herein elicited.,,,0,,,,,,,
The CCI Phase I SoW [RD 7] is here analysed to extract a series of business goals pertinent to the operational system.,,,1,,,,,,,
"The operational system is the operationalisation of the Task 3 prototype production system, that is a production system and the engineering in of capability onto the production system to allow it to be used in the outside world, following its construction by CCI Phase II.",,,1,,,,,,,
"We are not directly concerned, therefore, with the activities leading up to the prototype production system, nor are we directly concerned with the activities at a meta-level associated with the CCI programme organisation, such as the listing of other CCI ECV programmes.",,0,,,,,,,,
"To that end, we have analyised the whole Phase I SoW, inferring business goals, which we illustrate with supporting evidence.",,0,0,,,,,,,
"Therefore, a business goal cannot be necessarily inferred by observation of the associated supported illustrativetext alone, but rather by absorption and analysis of the whole document.",,0,1,,,,,,,
"With SLCCI-SRB-BUSINESS- GOAL_#1, for example, we propose that since the scientific community represent the end users of the operational system, their expectations with regards to the performance of the operational system must be taken into account.",,,1,,,,,,,
We recognise the matter of cost effectiveness across the ECVs as imperative to achieving cost effectiveness.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Supporting evidence – “address the need for establishing data service systems that ensure ongoing accessibility to the Climate Data Sets into the future as well as the required capacity to update these data sets periodically by addition of new data or by reprocessing complete records when calibration improves or ECV generation methods evolve” [RD 7, pg 27].",,,1,,,,,,,
"Therefore, the axiomatic needs of the SLCCI system are made concrete directly in the System Requirements Baseline, so mitigating risk of loss of vision of the system during development.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"To accommodate this endeavour in an apt manner during the requirements stage, it is envisaged that the SLCCI system will hook in to higher level Central Information System (CIS) [RD 11], available at the CCI level across all ECV projects (including, in this content, SLCCI), with each ECV implementing its own INSPIRE compliant interoperability with the Central Information System.",,1,,,,,,,,
Metadata will be associated with SLCCI in order to describe all output sea level products.,,1,,,,,,,,
"To this end, it is pertinent to eliminate or manage any constraints to the SLCCI inherited from DUACS.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"However, use of DUACS towards reuse has been proven in the context of MyOcean, a large scale multi- variable processing and dissemination system, so proving that DUACS is capable of serving for reuse.",,1,,,,,,,,
"To this end, the SRD declares the differences between the original DUACS system and the target SLCCI system (Section 6.3) to legitimise and reason the mapping.",,1,1,,,,,,,
These differences are observed during Requirements Analysis (which takes as its input the raw requirements mapping reasoned during Requirements Elicitation) in order to reason all changes necessary for those requirements which are derived based on the mapping from the original system.,,,1,,,,,,,
"The elicitation of business goals from the CCI Statement of Work not only highlight the welcoming of system reuse, directly (as SoW explicit content on system reuse) and indirectly (via SoW content on cost efficiencies) , but also the adoption of latest technologies; to this end, the adoption of an existing, mature, system needs to legitimise the balance undertaken of reuse of existing technology with adoption of, or integration with, more novel technologies towards provision of a system of apt quality and timeliness.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"Such constraints are important during SLCCI design, in meeting apt and reasoned reuse of the existing DUACS system.",,1,,,,,,,,
"During the design stage, the output of which is communicated in the form of the System Design Document (SDD), this pertinent matter will be attended to at the very earliest opportunity.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"While interacting with the system, he is to be considered as an actor and uses specific system capabilities.",,1,1,,,,,,,
While performing additional manual or procedural tasks and eventually storing his results in the System.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Note that every contributor type is involved in each of NRT, DT and REP production ; each type has a higher frequency of activity involved in the NRT production only because NRT productions are daily compared to other productions which are of a lower frequency (REP,DT).",,1,,,,,,,,
"To this end, a Central Information System (CIS) is adopted for SLCCI.",,0,,,,,,,,
The SLCCI users relate to climatology research and so do not require degraded-quality NRT data products.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, for example, there are two direct sub-types of SLCCI User, namely an SLCCI Contributor and an SLCCI Product User; in other words, an SLCCI Contributor is an SLCCI User and an SLCCI Product User is an SLCCI User.",,0,,,,,,,,
Indeed all user types in the diagram are SLCCI Users since the SLCCI User type is the ultimate base type of all user types.,,1,1,,,,,,,
"To this end, the figure below offers an illustration of the SLCCI equivalent Use Case packages adopted.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The following four sections will argue for the apt mapping of use cases and their associated system requirements to the SLCCI system, with each section representing one of the four use case packages, thus covering the entire use case package spectrum.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Given the evidence and argument so far composed, we may judiciously define a mapping of use cases and subsequently a mapping of the system requirements contained therein, from DUACS to SLCCI.",,1,,,,,,,,
We therefore envisage the same use case to macro functionality parallel for the SLCCI as is the case with DUACS.,,0,1,,,,,,,
For convenience we explicitly map between SLCCI and DUACS macro functionalities rather than between their associated use cases.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Given the evidence provided thus far, we argue that the DUACS production Use Cases, and therefore their associated macro functionalities, map to SLCCI equivalents.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"Again, the SLCCI equivalents, described in the Requirements Analysis, will illustrate where changes are likened or necessary in order to accommodate the mapping, for instance the adoption of ftp and OPENDAP.",,,1,,,,,,,
"However, where the mapping does not hold is that no higher level service desk exists for SLCCI, therefore the SLCCI service desk (i.e that at the level of the SLCCI rather than a higher level system) is referred to instead; it is d however that there is the potential to glue SLCCI to a higher level pan-ECV system, given that DUACS, in the frame of MyOcean SL TAC equivalent, already resides in a pan-variable infrastructure.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"As earlier indicated, it is proposed that the SLCCI system have a Central Information System (CIS) equivalent to the MyOcean Information System (MIS) component, and therefore the mapping to an SLCCI equivalent during Requirements Analysis (Chapter 7) will accomodate the SLCCI equivalent accordingly.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"Again, an Information System is not proposed for the SLCCI system, as it is not currently warranted.",,1,,,,,,,,
However this could be a valuable solution when relying on (at least partly) existing systems.,,1,1,,,,,,,
These matters are considered further during Requirements Analysis (Chapter 7) where the raw systems requirements mapping is exercised to produce and refine SLCCI equivalents.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Each update (creation/deletion of a Product Line/Product specification, authorization of a Product) of the Products Database by the SL TAC Product Manager has to be reported to the Top-Level Product Manager for a validation (particularly regarding the state of a Product: operational or not).",,,0,,,,,,,
"Certain DUACS requirements, as realised for MyOcean SL TAC, must be refined in order to reach their SLCCI equivalents, for instance the defining of raw measurements, and depiction of the CRM tool to be used.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"This dashboard allows Service Desk members (Support Operators, Service Managers), at all levels, to know the ""health"" of the Top Level Services at a glance.",,,1,,,,,,,
"As earlier indicated, ITIL Processes are irrelevant to SLCCI and therefore fall out of scope of the SLCCI system requirements.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"As earlier indicated, the SLCCI equivalent system will have a Central Information System (CIS), residing at the CCI level, equivalent to the MIS component, and therefore SLCCI requirements will reflect this equivalency.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"Deferment of certain DUACS characteristics to a Service Management Plan, necessitates examination of the Service Management Plan during Requirements Analysis.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Therefore, the three types of monitoring proposed in the DUACS system are similarly adopted for the SLCCI system.",,0,1,,,,,,,
"As its input, therefore, the Requirements Analysis accepts a reasoned, though unrefined, system requirements between DUACS and SLCCI, based on argued equivalences of user hierarchy, scope, use case packages, use cases, and their associated system requirements during the Requirements Elicitation.",,0,,,,,,,,
"Where the mapping is not possible to an SLCCI equivalent, this is reasoned.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"Similarly, where a mapping needs to be such that a pertinent difference must hold, then an explicit reference is made to the difference, in order to allow the mapping; the set of differences between the DUACS system, as realised for MyOcean SL TAC, and SLCCI have been given.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"To help maintain operational integrity to the system, transparency to the performance gathering aspects of the system should also warrant consideration, such as in the gathering of operational statistics.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"Use of such standards differs to those to be adopted within the System Specification Document, where candidate standards are identified and a chosen standard reasoned towards helping satisfy system requirements.",,1,,,,,,,,
We do so by expressing the accommodation of these desired user requirements.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Our analysis of the PSD [RD 6] allows us to recognise the production chain product types, to be outputted by the operational system.",,,1,,,,,,,
Recognition of types of auxiliary data input by analysing ([RD2] §5).,,,0,,,,,,,
"We draw on ECSS-Q-ST-80C (Space Product Assurance) towards establishing reasonable expectations for software quality which should be satisfied by the future implementers during Phase II; these are not only beneficial in order for the Phase I SSD to be satisfied, but of benefit to Phase II implementers needing to formally attain and verify good practice.",,,1,,,,,,,
We analyse the PSAD [RD 3] to support the construction of the System Requirements Baseline.,,1,,,,,,,,

"Rationale: Exploration communication systems will need to support multiple signal formats, data rates, network management scenarios and interface with different ground and space assets during the various mission phases.",,,,1,1,,,,,
"Rationale: Gateway communications with Earth enables data transfer between Earth and the Gateway (including commands, file uploads, telemetry, engineering and science data, voice, video and images, and crew-related data), as well as supports tracking and position determination of the Gateway.",,,,1,,,,,,
Therefore the Gateway will have to have the necessary architecture framework and communications resources to support 3 or more simultaneous RF links.,,,,0,0,,,,,
The Gateway shall communicate with Earth without placing constraints on flight attitudes during nominal operations.,,,,1,1,,,,,
"This means that the Gateway communication system(s), during nominal operations, must be able to support communications with Earth in any flight attitude.",,,,0,1,,,,,
"Rationale: Gateway will need to provide communication data downlink capacity to support science, payload, crew, etc.",,,,1,1,,,,,
Rationale: Lunar System assets will require command and telemetry links to execute command and relay data from their sensors and experiments to the Gateway.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Visiting Vehicles (VV), having their own comm link to earth, will also be capable of communicating directly with the ground while docked at Gateway.",,,,1,1,,,,,
Gateway and these VV will pre-coordinate to ensure communication links don’t interfere with each other.,,,,0,1,,,,,
"In addition, the radiometric tracking will provide range and range rate information to the VV’s GNC system to augment its navigation sensor information.",,,,1,,,,,,
"To maintain compatibility with Orion rendezvous link, the ICSIS defines this link at S-band.",,,,1,1,,,,,
The Gateway shall support direct voice communications between crewed spacecraft during proximity operations.,,,,1,1,,,,,
The Gateway shall provide an antenna and RF electronics connecting to visiting vehicles to provide communications coverage during RPOD.,,,,1,1,,,,,
Having the co-manifested module provide antenna and RF electronics and connecting these to Orion's comm system will provide the necessary communication coverage between Orion and Gateway during RPOD.,,,,1,,,,,,
Rationale: Crewmembers must maintain voice communication with ground systems during nominal and off-nominal activities.,,,,1,1,,,,,
"Other off-nominal events may require wearing a contingency breathing apparatus, which may hinder clear communication between crewmembers, which is essential during an emergency.",,,,1,1,,,,,
Rationale: Coordinated control is needed on the vehicle level.,,,,1,,,,,,
Command hierarchy should be enforced to ensure proper and robust configuration and control of vehicle.,,,,1,1,,,,,
Orderly flow of data and commands reduces complexity and increases robustness.,,,,0,0,,,,,
This will necessitate the capability for autonomous operations.,,,,0,0,,,,,
The Gateway VSM will manage the resource of bandwidth in order to provide the ground controllers with the best possible information.,,,,1,1,,,,,
The curation of data must occur throughout the vehicle because of limited processing and network resources throughout the spacecraft.,,,,1,1,,,,,
Rationale: Data flow through the Gateway System ensures all modules and systems are receiving the information required to operate the vehicle and achieve objectives set forth in the Mission Plan.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Rationale: State data critical for recovery or restoration of Gateway systems ensures ongoing operation of the vehicle if a situation arises where a system must fault down, safe, and recover.",,,,1,1,,,,,
"When software secures data, it takes steps to ensure the data is correct in storage.",,,,1,1,,,,,
"As such, securing state data reduces the risk of an incomplete or insufficient recovery due to data integrity issues.",,,,1,1,,,,,
"During off-nominal events, crew attention should be directed to commensurate with the urgency of the situation and the use of multiple modalities, e.g., both visual and auditory, provides redundancy to ensure the attention of the crew; except for advisories, which may not have an auditory annunciation.",,,,1,1,,,,,
The Gateway shall be able to update executable Flight Software (FSW) and configuration data to support ongoing vehicle operations and configurations.,,,,1,1,,,,,
"Rationale: As the Gateway increases in capacity and capability, software updates will be required to meet changing objectives.",,,,1,1,,,,,
Providing the capability to update all executable FSW and configuration data will provide flexibility.,,,,,1,,,,,
This capability allows the Gateway to stage software releases.,,,,0,,,,,,
"If the crew vacates one module of the system or transfers to another Human-Rated system as part of the reference mission, there is a capability for humans to monitor the unoccupied modules.",,,,1,1,,,,,
"In some of these cases, the crew may be able to perform this function from their new location.",,,,0,,,,,,
"In other cases, mission control may perform this function.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Given that communication with the Ground will be minimal and Crew visits infrequent, routine maintenance and servicing that keeps the software operating efficiently must be automated to eliminate dependencies on human operators.",,,,,1,1,,,,
These self-maintenance tasks will be conducted with minimal to no impact on Gateway operations during crewed and uncrewed flight phases.,,,,,1,0,,,,
Any application developed as a cFS compatible software configuration item can be re-hosted on another module as long as processor capacity exists.,,,,,1,,,,,
The Gateway shall provide the capability to isolate and recover from faults identified during system development or mission operations that would result in a catastrophic event.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"The intent is to provide isolation and recovery from faults where the system design (e.g., redundant strings or system isolation) enables the implementation of this capability.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Also, any faults identified during system development should be protected by isolation and recovery.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"However, it is acknowledged that not all faults that would cause catastrophic events can be detected or isolated in time to avoid the event.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Similarly, system design cannot ensure that once the fault is detected and isolated that a recovery is always possible.",,,,,,1,,,,
"However, in these cases, isolation of the fault should prevent the catastrophic event.",,,,,0,0,,,,
The crewed Gateway shall provide the capability for the onboard crew to manually override software functionality when the transition to manual operation will not cause a catastrophic event.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"The intent of this requirement is to allow crew intervention of the crewed space system and/or subsystem software to perform operations that would nominally be automated, or when software design is incapable of responding appropriately or as desired to real-time events.",,,,,1,0,,,,
"While this capability should be derived by the program per requirement L2-GW-0310 Crew Monitor/Operate/Control Capability, the critical nature of software control and automation at the highest system level dictates specific mention in this requirement set.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The displays and controls for manual intervention should be conveniently located, readily accessible, and intuitive for the intended task and its duration as long as the transition to/from manual operation is feasible and will not cause a catastrophic event.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Identifying which specific automated functions require the crew override capability will be driven by task analysis with concurrence from the Gateway Program, the JSC Flight Operations Directorate and the Technical Authorities.",,1,,,,1,,,,
"The most robust satisfaction of this requirement is provided by direct manual flight control of the vehicle translation and attitude, through an independent flight control pathway (bypassing the affected vehicle guidance, navigation, and control system failures).",,,,,,1,,,,
A minimum implementation of manual flight control allows the crew to bypass the automated guidance of the vehicle by interfacing directly with the flight control system to effect any possible attitude or translation change/adjustment within the capability of Gateway’s design.,,,,,,1,,,,
Safe operation requires accuracy of crew inputs to meet human rating requirements.,,,,,1,,,,,
Tools will be verified in a Gateway flight-like environment to ensure they are adequate to support manual control and operations.,,,,,1,1,,,,
Monitoring helps to create situational awareness that improves the performance of the human operator and enhances the mission.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"Specifically, if a valve or relay can be controlled by a computer, then that same control could be offered to the crew to perform that function.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"However, a crew member probably could not operate individual valves that meter the flow of propellant to the engines, but the function could be replaced by a throttle that incorporates multiple valve movements to achieve a desired end state (reduce or increase thrust).",,,,,,1,,,,
"The first condition recognizes that the crew performs functions to meet mission objectives and, in those cases, the crew is provided the designated capabilities.",,,,,,1,,,,
This does not mean that the crew is provided these capabilities for all elements of a mission.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Many considerations are involved in making these determinations, including capability to perform the function and reaction time.",,,,,,1,,,,
Rationale: Three separate cables must run between the elements in order to meet TTE fault tolerance specification.,,,,,1,1,,,,
The architecture must account for a capacity that considers the modules’ systems data and additional storage capacity that can be accessed and used by the Gateway.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The overall capacity needed will be determined by assessing the mission configuration, module and systems data priorities, and anticipated operations.",,,,,,1,,,,
Robot mass and power can be reduced if some of the processing can happen off board the robot.,,,,,1,1,,,,
The Gateway shall provide crew displays and controls that are operable by a crewmember from within any habitable environment.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: Crew capability (data/command interfaces) provides monitoring of the C&W as well as nominal and off-nominal control of life support, thermal control, communication, and other system functions necessary for safe operations from any habitable module.",,,,,,0,,,,
The Gateway shall provide internal lighting for the illumination required for all operational tasks dependent on visible light.,,,,,,1,,,,
Rationale: A wide range of crew and robotic tasks is expected to be performed within the vehicle.,,,,,,1,,,,
The required lighting levels vary depending on the task being performed.,,,,,,1,,,,
"During waking hours, lighting systems must provide the crew with retinal light exposure that is sufficient in intensity, optimal in wavelength, and implemented at the proper times and durations to entrain the human circadian pacemaker to a 24-hour day and facilitate schedule shifting.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Effective lighting systems for internal operational environments support human/camera color vision within the appropriate chromaticity range, color accuracy, and allow for control, position adjustment, and glare prevention.",,,,,1,,,,,
The Gateway shall illuminate external surfaces <TBR-L2-GW-014> required for all operational tasks dependent on external visible light.,,,,,,1,,,,
Supplemental lighting is required in order for imagery to be acceptable.,,,,,1,1,,,,
This is needed for EVA situational awareness and will be helpful for EVR operations.,,,,,1,0,,,,
"Rationale: An integrated Modular Power System will be implemented across Gateway to provide power to the Gateway systems, utilization, and visiting vehicles.",,,,,1,1,,,,
The Gateway Program Subsystem Specification for Power defines the specific functionality required from the modular power system to enable the interoperability and compatibility of both the electrical power system and the electrical power consuming equipment across all Gateway power interfaces.,,,,,,1,,,,
The Gateway shall provide a minimum of 32kW for Gateway use when SEP is inactive.,,,,,1,1,,,,
When the SEP is inactive there will be a minimum of 32kW available to transfer.,,,,,1,1,,,,
It is expected that more than 32kW is available and can be distributed when both power domains are utilized.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"Rationale: While critical systems must be capable of running from a single power domain, more power above allocated limits is available when SEP is not being utilized or is running at low power.",,,,,1,1,,,,
This bi-directional power transmission allows module launch order independence and integrates the Gateway distributed battery system to be able to power the Gateway during eclipses and allows the distributed batteries to recharge.,,,,,1,1,,,,
The Gateway will provide redundant primary power transmission to each radial docking port to provide the adjoining (docked) Gateway element access to the over-all Gateway primary power.,,,,,1,1,,,,
The bi-directional power transmission to each radial docking port allows element launch order independence with either Gateway HAB element and integrates the Gateway distributed battery system to be able to power the Gateway during eclipses and allows the distributed batteries to recharge.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"The radial docking port primary power system interfaces are redundant, meaning that in case of a single radial docking connector failure, the remaining docking connector has to transfer at least 16 kW.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Rationale: To facilitate Gateway power quality verification without the presence of all Gateway modules and power consuming equipment within an integrated test, the Gateway will provide dc-isolation between the Gateway primary power domain and the secondary power domain of the applicable elements.",,,,,1,1,,,,
This will allow independent power quality verification of all Gateway secondary loads and it will allow independent verification of the Gateway primary power.,,,,,0,0,,,,
Source and load emulators will be required to verify the power quality between power interfaces.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"The module-to-module primary power is redundant, meaning that in case of a single docking system connector failure, the remaining NDS connector has to carry the full limit of a single power domain.",,,,,1,1,,,,
The Gateway shall provide energy storage capacity capable of supplying a minimum of 32kW during non-insolation periods of at least 1.5 hrs.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"Rationale: Once a module is attached to the Gateway, that module's battery is part of the integrated Gateway primary power system and feeds all elements of the Gateway.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Collectively, all the batteries have to supply power to the Gateway during non-insolation periods such as an eclipse.",,,,,1,1,,,,
The 1.5 hours is based on a Lunar synodic resonance NRHO which will essentially eliminate the Earth shadow and keep the Lunar eclipses less than 1.5 hours.,,,,,1,,,,,
The Gateway shall provide a minimum of 24kW for system use when SEP is active.,,,,,1,1,,,,
The 24kW electrical power value represents the minimum required continuous transfer power that is transferred to all Gateway electrical loads other than to the PPE housekeeping when the SEP is active and consuming up to 26.6kW.,,,,,1,1,,,,
The Gateway elements will be required to adhere to the Gateway Element Power Allocation Tables to prevent excessive power demands from over loading the PPE array.,,,,,1,1,,,,
Rationale: Utilization needs to have a minimum of 4kW power reserved to support the various utilization and science objectives planned for Gateway.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: First time power activation of the Gateway element or a restart after being completely deactivated will be accomplished by applying power to either the GSE, initial delivery vehicle, or Gateway primary power interfaces.",,,,,,1,,,,
The start-up sequence will automatically energize the appropriate power and avionics equipment to get the element to a commandable state.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The Gateway will support the use of internal portable electrical equipment, science, and robotics by providing standard common electrical outlets that provide electrical shock hazard protection.",,,,,1,,,,,
The Gateway shall provide imagery to support operations during all mission phases.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"Rationale: Gateway needs to provide for privacy during personal crew communications including private space, internal cameras, etc.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Rationale: Top-level requirement establishing the need for any Gateway-generated imagery (and associated audio, where applicable) to be made available to the crew.",,,,,,1,,,,
Audio/Video Synchronization with the Gateway onboard clock can occur at the source or on the ground depending on implementation.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Rationale: Top-level requirement establishing the need for any Gateway-generated imagery (and associated audio, where applicable) to be recorded onboard.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Rationale: Top-level requirement establishing the need for the Gateway vehicle to generate imagery (with associated audio, where applicable) and make that imagery available to other Exploration systems (Orion, Mission Systems, etc.).",,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: An integrated Environmental Control and Life Support System will be implemented across Gateway to ensure habitability across all habitable volumes, including visiting vehicles attached and open to the Gateway.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The Gateway Program Subsystem Specification for ECLSS defines the specific functionality required of the ECLSS to enable top level capabilities, associated design standards, and module level functional and performance requirements.",,,,,,1,,,,
The Gateway shall condition the atmosphere in habitable volumes and attached visiting vehicles to maintain temperature and humidity levels and to provide proper atmosphere circulation within the habitable volumes.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"Rationale: Air conditioning includes circulation of air to ensure proper mixing, and maintaining the temperature and humidity levels within system capabilities.",,,,,1,1,,,,
This function must be performed during crewed and uncrewed periods to protect both crew and vehicle systems.,,,,,1,0,,,,
Rationale: Potable water is necessary to maintain crew hydration during Gateway operations.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"Water may also be needed for operating science and technology payloads, and other systems such as the EVA suit.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"The Gateway shall provide fire detection, suppression, isolation, and recovery for any internal fire events when there are potential flammable materials or ignition sources present, or credible oxygen enrichment.",,,,,1,1,,,,
This capability is needed in both crewed and uncrewed mission phases.,,,,,1,,,,,
End item fire protection is accomplished primarily by controlling flammable materials and ignition sources.,,,,,1,,,,,
"If materials flammability and electrical requirements are not met, detection and suppression must be discussed during the safety review process.",,,,,1,1,,,,
Gateway shall maintain airborne contaminants below applicable limits for nominal human performance during crewed periods.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Additionally, particles associated with lunar regolith may be presented to the Gateway after a human lunar mission and through lunar sample return through the Science Airlock.",,,,,1,,,,,
"While collection is only applicable during the crewed period, any long term storage may need to be managed during the uncrewed period.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Venting of pretreated urine must be coordinated with structures and external systems, and must be balanced or non-propulsive to minimize Gateway stack attitude impulses.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The Gateway shall provide emergency equipment for crew survival, accessible within the time required to respond to the emergency.",,,,,,1,,,,
Rationale: This is hardware needed in each element with hazards that might lead to a compromised atmosphere to allow crew to translate to a safe location within Gateway or the vehicle intended for crew return to Earth.,,,,,1,0,,,,
Hardware must be readily accessible to allow escape in the shortest amount of time.,,,,,1,1,,,,
Likewise an emergency lighting system must be automatically activated to allow operators and other occupants of a module to move to a safe location in the minimum amount of time.,,,,,1,0,,,,
"The portable hardware classified as emergency equipment should be provided as Common Equipment to the modules to ensure commonality, compatibility, and portability.",,,,,1,1,,,,
The Gateway shall be designed to operate in atmospheric conditions with 0% humidity during uncrewed periods.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: During crewed operations, the dew point will remain within crew comfort levels.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"During the uncrewed period, the cabin may be very dry with a dew point less than 4C (39F) at lowest allowable temperature.",,,,,1,1,,,,
Humidity may be removed purposefully to prevent condensation and microbial growth.,,,,,1,1,,,,
The humidity will passively be reduced as the pressure is maintained with dry gasses and no crew is present to replenish atmospheric vapor.,,,,,1,,,,,
Appropriate design of electronics must be included to control electrostatic discharge (ESD) hazards.,,,,,1,,,,,
Rationale: Enriched oxygen concentrations increase the flammability of materials within that environment.,,,,,1,,,,,
Rationale: Elevated oxygen concentrations are needed at lower pressures to sustain human life.,,,,,1,1,,,,
The Gateway shall maintain an internal habitable environment at pressures between 65 kPa (9.5 psia) to 102 kPa (14.9 psia), with the exception of airlocks.,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: When crewed, the Gateway will be nominally maintained at pressures near to Earth sea level 101 kPa (14.7 psi).",,,,,1,1,,,,
"The full range allows for operational flexibility during crewed and uncrewed periods, including response to contingency scenarios and potential reduction of consumables during uncrewed periods.",,,,,1,0,,,,
Pressurized modules have a design pressure for structural design purposes higher than 14.9 psia to account for pressure set points of positive pressure relief valves (PPRVs) and fault tolerance of the ECLS system.,,,,,,1,,,,
Rationale: This requirements establishes the full temperature control range for the Gateway during both crewed and uncrewed periods.,,,,,,1,,,,
The Gateway will maintain temperatures according to crew capability during crewed mission phases.,,,,,1,1,,,,
Rationale: Vestibule pressurization is required prior to hatch opening between modules and to allow a visiting vehicle to be opened to the Gateway Habitation Element.,,,,,,1,,,,
This is required during crewed and uncrewed mission phases.,,,,,0,0,,,,
The Gateway shall limit disturbances caused by venting of fluids and gasses per the <TBD-L2- GW-059> table.,,,,,,1,,,,
Modules within the Habitation Element will be capable of sharing thermal control resources with an adjacent module for flexibility during contingencies.,,,,,1,1,,,,
Each module may utilize active and/or passive thermal control methods to meet thermal requirements.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"Thermal Control Subsystem Specification defines the specific functionality required to enable top level capabilities, associated design standards, and element/module level functional and performance requirements.",,,,,,1,,,,
Any modules with habitable volumes must also maintain the internal environment within thermal limits for both crewed and uncrewed operations.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Thermal Control System to operate within thermal limits at any attitude necessary, making its performance flight attitude independent.",,,,,1,,,,,
"However, indefinite duration capability at any attitude is not possible, so duration limits must be established and provided to stakeholders.",,,,,1,,,,,
The Gateway shall apply an architecture that provides for module thermal independence during non-contingency operations.,,,,,1,0,,,,
Rationale: Each Module's TCS will need to be responsible for its own thermal independence and ability to manage its own heatloads during nominal operations.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"Rationale: Providing a common set of functional requirements for all Gateway crew hatches simplifies crew training, eases operations, increases reliability of operation, and streamlines the development process by providing a ready set of base requirements for an end item specification.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"The Gateway shall continuously record structural dynamic responses at discrete locations and process data to assess structural life consumption and perform damage detection, location, and assessment.",,,,,,1,,,,
The structural health monitoring system is required to measure responses of the Gateway to actual dynamic loads in order to assess structural life usage vs predicted loads.,,,,,1,1,,,,
Knowledge of life state can be used to modify operations to either add constraints to protect structural life or to reduce un-needed constraints.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Due to limitations on crew time and other Gateway resources, automated structural damage detection, location, and assessment can be utilized to determine criticality of damage and focus remediation efforts.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Rationale: Detection of leaks will allow for response and repair, in the event of an atmospheric leak, by the crew or autonomously.",,,,,1,1,,,,
The Gateway shall localize atmospheric leaks to within <TBD-L2-GW-012> location in any pressurized habitable volume.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: Localization of leaks will allow for response and repair, in the event of an atmospheric leak, by the crew during crewed periods or autonomously during uncrewed periods.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Rationale: DSG-SPEC-MECH-017, Gateway Program Docking System Specification compliant mechanisms only provide an 800mm diameter passageway for a distance of 3-4 ft when mated.",,,,,,1,,,,
Items to be transferred between Gateway Elements need to be sized appropriately.,,,,,1,1,,,,
The Gateway shall be equipped with passive or active crew exercise equipment isolation systems to reduce induced loads to the primary structure to less than or equal to <TBD-L2-GW- Gateway structure.,,,,,1,1,,,,
The Gateway shall have a Probability of No Penetration (PNP) greater than or equal to for items with the potential to create a catastrophic hazard if impacted or punctured by MMOD.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"For the purposes of MMOD, a penetration is defined as damage/failure to stored energy devices that causes a hazard to crew or Gateway survivability.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Typically, penetration is defined as a partial or complete perforation of the pressure vessel or casing, detached spall from the pressure vessel wall, damage to the pressure vessel that would allow unstable crack growth, or deformation of a casing of rotating machinery such that the deformation could intrude into the dynamic envelope of the rotating device.",,,,,,1,,,,
The Gateway shall provide at least single failure tolerance to catastrophic events.,,,,,,0,,,,
"Catastrophic hazards that cannot be controlled using failure tolerance may be exempted from the failure tolerance requirements with mandatory concurrence from the Technical Authorities and Director, Johnson Space Center (JSC) (for crew risk acceptance).",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Exemptions from failure tolerance shall be requested in accordance with DSG-RQMT-011, Gateway Hazard Analysis Requirements.",,,,,,1,,,,
Rationale: Compliance with this requirement can be accomplished at the end item level or through a combination of hazard controls at the Module/System levels and end item level.,,,,,1,,,,,
A common way to improve reliability and thus meet safety requirements is to use systems that tolerate failures when complete failure avoidance isn’t practical.,,,,,1,1,,,,
Acceptance of these approaches by the Technical Authorities avoids processing waivers for numerous hazard causes where failure tolerance is not the appropriate approach.,,,,,1,1,,,,
Additional failure tolerance may be required to meet systems reliability requirements.,,,,,1,0,,,,
"The Gateway shall provide the capability for autonomous operation of system and subsystem functions, which if lost, would result in a catastrophic event.",,,,,1,,,,,
"While the crew is present, the Gateway should automate catastrophic hazard controls to minimize the need for crew actions, using crew action only as a last resort where automation is not practical.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Rationale: Critical hazards do not require failure tolerance for human-rating, however, critical hazards can have a significant impact on Loss of Mission (LOM) risk.",,,,,0,,,,,
Failure tolerance for critical hazards may be required to meet probability of loss of mission or system reliability requirements (if applicable).,,,,,1,1,,,,
"Rationale: Emergency systems, EVA or emergency operations cannot be used as a leg of failure tolerance as these emergency systems and equipment cannot definitively prevent an initiating event.",,,,,1,,,,,
"As a result, the mitigation of catastrophic and critical hazards will implement a FT strategy without the use of EVA, emergency systems, or emergency operations.",,,,,0,,,,,
"However, the use of EVA, emergency systems, and contingency or emergency operations will be considered a Crew Survival Method (CSM) to prevent Loss of Crew (LOC) in the event all other approved hazard controls have failed.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"The Gateway shall protect redundant systems, redundant subsystems, and redundant major elements of subsystems (such as assemblies, panels, power supplies, tanks, controls, and associated interconnecting wiring and fluid lines) to ensure that an unexpected event which damages one is not likely to prevent the other from performing the functions.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Rationale: Where redundancy is used to satisfy the failure tolerance requirement, this design requirement provides maximum protection from common cause events.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"System analysis needs to consider the channelization of all capabilities necessary to manage Fault, Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) including sensors and utility services such as power, thermal and data.",,,,,,0,,,,
The NASA-STD is a companion to NPR 8715.6 and provides specific requirements and assessment methods to assure compliance with the NPR.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Extensive human casualty studies by the U.S. Government, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, have examined the probability of injury and/or death from falling debris for a variety of impacting kinetic energies to humans.",,,,,,1,,,,
The Gateway shall provide a habitable volume that accommodates crew living and working tasks.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: To maintain a habitable volume and high level of mission performance and safety, it is important that the architectural layout of the vehicle is functionally designed to provide defined locations and volumes that allow for expected crew activities, including mission operations, habitability functions, and translation (for example, movement between areas).",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Adequate internal size, in terms of volume and surface area, needs to be provided to ensure expected number of crewmembers can safely, efficiently, and effectively perform mission tasks, including, but not limited to, work, sleep, eat, personal hygiene, private crew areas, translation, egress, ingress, pressurized suit donning, emergency medical treatment, and other tasks necessary for a safe and successful mission.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Mission and volume designers are to carefully analyze volume needs of the crew, crew equipment, storage, trash containment volumes and trash transition plans to ensure they are adequately sized to provide adequate net habitable volume for the crew to effectively and efficiently perform mission objectives.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Every effort should be made to separate functional areas for activities that could degrade or operationally conflict with each other, particularly emergency response activities, or that produce environmental conditions that are detrimental to mission performance or safety (for example, glare, noise, vibrations, heat, odors, etc.).",,,,,1,1,,,,
Co-location of unrelated activities could degrade operations resulting in increased workload and operational delays.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Similarly, co-location of related, sequential functional work areas can reduce transit time, communication errors, and operational delays.",,,,,1,,,,,
"For example, food stowage and food preparation areas should be located near one another to minimize the time required to retrieve food for meals and promote group dining for behavioral health benefits; and consistent spatial orientation and visual distinctions such as identifiers and aids can promote effective execution of mission tasking.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The management of crew nutrition is defined as influencing the design, provision, and operational implementation of in-flight nourishment of crewmembers over the course of the mission to perform Gateway tasks.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Clinical care provides in-flight capabilities for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and long-term management of medical conditions.",,,,,,1,,,,

Pharmacy management provides in-flight capabilities for the administration of pharmaceuticals in support of clinical care and includes all medications and the mechanisms used to prepare and deliver them and track their use.,,,,,,1,,,,
"NASA-STD-3001, Volume 1, includes definitions of the levels of medical care required to reduce the risk that exploration missions are impacted by crew medical issues and to ensure that long-term astronaut health risks are managed within acceptable limits.",,,,,,1,,,,
"As mission duration and complexity increase, the capability required to prevent and manage medical contingencies correspondingly increases.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"To date, there have been multiple illnesses and injuries during all mission phases and, in the absence of adequate clinical capabilities, the likelihood of significant negative impact to mission viability due to crewmember illness or injury is increased.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Because immediate transport to a clinical facility is not an option on-orbit, in flight health care is essential and is optimal with an integrated crew health data system, to support the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of illness and injury.",,,,,1,,,,,
"During missions with longer evacuation times and mission duration, the management of data, information, and ability for extensible knowledge augmentation becomes increasingly important in order to manage the medical care and wellness of the crew efficiently.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"To aid the crew in basic decision support through automatic organization of data and knowledge augmentation materials (such as medical references), an integrated system should collect, process, and store all crew health-relevant data from various sources (vehicle and ground), in addition to crew task performance data, and make this data available to both the crewmembers and ground support.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Necessary capabilities include data sources interfaces for secure data collection, data storage, descriptive analytics, advanced analytics, and data user interfaces.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Descriptive analytics provides in-flight capabilities for modelling and analytics, data mining, discovery and search and report generation.",,,,,,1,,,,
Advanced analytics can provide in-flight capabilities to store knowledge bases and provide basic decision support functionality.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Data user interfaces provides in-flight capabilities for the crewmembers to interface with the vehicle's habitat data infrastructure, including messaging, data input, and display.",,,,,,1,,,,
Behavioral health management is needed to prevent and ameliorate the deleterious effects of living in an isolated and confined space and to preserve both individual and “crew as a unit” behavioral health and performance and cohesive functionality.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"The management of crew behavioral health includes: design, provision, operational implementation, and hardware/software that is necessary to provide in-flight behavioral health support.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The management of crew physiological health is defined as influencing the design, provision, and operational implementation of in-flight pre, in, and post-flight countermeasures systems to mitigate risks to crew health and performance.",,,,,,1,,,,
Human health and performance optimization tools will require incorporation of vehicle systems data and other CHP systems data in a data management system that will allow for running existing algorithms to inform/predict crew health and performance capabilities.,,,,,,1,,,,
The intent of this specific countermeasures is to align with the phased approach of using Gateway as a proving ground to develop tools for improved crew autonomy.,,,,,,1,,,,
Rationale: Limiting the transfer of microorganisms to the food preparation areas protects crew health.,,,,,1,,,,,
"To properly control the contamination of the food preparation area from the body waste management and hygiene areas, a task analysis must be performed to identify important design factors (i.e. concurrent use of the areas, volume needed at each location to prevent contact, distance between areas, storage and accessibility requirements, etc.).",,,,,1,1,,,,
"While vehicle design constraints may limit the distance between the areas, measures must be in place to prevent food contamination during preparation, such as a higher quality body waste containment and isolation system.",,,,,1,0,,,,
"Toxicological protection ensures in-flight capabilities for toxicological monitoring, assessment, and mitigation in Gateway air and water.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Rationale: Environmental hazard protection includes capabilities to measure, monitor, assess, alert, and respond to microbial concerns in the Gateway atmosphere.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Microbial environmental protection ensures in-flight capabilities for monitoring and mitigating microbial contamination in the air, water, and surfaces as well as capabilities for decontamination.",,,,,1,1,,,,
This also includes the capability to maintain personal hygiene and have adequate food and waste storage.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: Environmental hazard protection includes capabilities to measure, monitor, assess, alert, and respond to acoustic concerns in the Gateway atmosphere.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Acoustic environmental protection ensures in-flight capabilities for monitoring, assessing, and mitigating harmful acoustic environments through hearing protection and acoustic and vibrational dampening countermeasures.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Rationale: Environmental hazard protection includes capabilities to measure, monitor, assess, alert, and respond to radiation concerns in the Gateway atmosphere.",,,,,,1,,,,
Radiation environmental protection ensures in-flight capabilities for the monitoring and provision of alerts and warnings for the space weather (ionizing radiation) environment.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"This also includes protection from, and treatment of, exposure to highly ionizing radiation environments, in addition to capabilities to maintain safe levels of non-ionizing radiation exposure.",,,,,,1,,,,

"Where the system is designed to protect for more than one inadvertent action, the level of protection after a single system failure may be reduced - but still protects from a single inadvertent operator action.",,,,,1,0,,,,
"In addition, this ensures that back-up capabilities, such as back-up flight software, maintain the same-level of tolerance to human error as the primary system.",,,,,0,0,,,,
HEA provides an evaluation of human actions and error in an effort to generate system improvements that reduce the frequency of error and minimize the negative effects on the system.,,,,,1,1,,,,
"The human error analysis considers mission operations while the crew is interacting with the space system - including crew operations, ground control operations (typically covered via hazard reports), and ground processing operations with flight crew interfaces.",,,,,,1,,,,

"On ISS this involved selection of a Torque Equilibrium Attitude (TEA) to maximize CMG control capacity, controlling exercise, not performing dockings or orbital maintenance, and inhibiting CMG desaturations when the robotic hardware was within 2 ft of structure.",,,,,1,1,,,,
"Rationale: Robotic end-to-end relocation will require a reconfiguration of TTE topology, as well as payload and ORU mate/demate operations.",,,,,,1,,,,

"These are designed to operate over aviation-protected spectrum, so any COCR ATS service could be allowed to be implemented via one or the other of these links (as appropriate).",,,1,,,,,,,
Updated information would be provided to filers if conditions along trajectory change with a user being able to submit alternative flight plans if needed.,,,1,,,,,,,
"After filing a flight plan and up until departure, weather and nonweather constrains that impact the plan as well as FAA mitigation strategies would be provided to the user.",,,1,,,,,,,

Interference studies proposed to be performed in the near future and the subsequent final technology selection will allow defining the channel plan.,,,1,,,,,,,
These are additional AOC services not specified in the COCR and therefore not addressed in the ITU Informational Paper ACP– WGF 19/IP01 as all other services.,,,1,,,,,,,
This architecture is necessarily presented at a high level because the L–DACS ConUse so far are very broad in scope.,,,1,,,,,,,
The main attributes of the current UAS would apply to the proposed system as well when services are provided over the L–DACS and as such are detailed below.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Conversely, pilot on-the-loop systems often only have single-thread LOS data links and higher latencies because the pilot is not in real-time control of the takeoff or landing maneuvers.",,,1,,,,,,,
"For example, if one of the links is temporarily suffering degradation, because of interference or propagation-related effects, then the other link in a different frequency band could take over the delivery of telecommands and telemetry, because interference and propagation effects are not correlated for the two links.",,,1,,,,,,,
"While most takeoff and landing activity is controlled using the LOS systems, at a manufacturer-specific altitude or range, the UAS is switched from LOS to BLOS control and is usually flown this way for the bulk of the distant flight activity.",,,1,,,,,,,
This allows the UA to make landings at distant locations and also allows for pilot relief.,,,1,,,,,,,
"To enhance link availability when using satellite communications, current UAS that fly BLOS missions often utilize two or three different satellite communications systems, all operating in parallel.",,,1,,,,,,,
"This is adequate when the control-station based VHF transceiver can maintain voice communication with the controlling ATC entity; however, for BLOS operation this is unacceptable.",,,1,,,,,,,
"However, the method for monitoring the voice traffic between the pilot and the VHF equipment, when it is carried by the aircraft flying a BLOS mission, is not specifically covered by current regulations.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Again, the level of autonomy plays a major part in what the UA does after losing its link, but in most cases the aircraft will fly a preplanned maneuver trying to reestablish any data link that might be available while making its way to a precoordinated location where it can be picked up again by the LOS system located at that facility.",,,1,,,,,,,
The pilot uses this data to maintain full awareness of the flight of the UA and to determine the changes needed to ensure safe flight.,,,0,,,,,,,
The pilot at the control station uses this information to maintain full awareness of the ability of the UA to function and to diagnose problems.,,,0,,,,,,,
The pilot can then handle potential or actual problems by taking preventive measures or corrective actions to ensure continued functioning and thus safe flight.,,,1,,,,,,,
"As d earlier, voice communication is not currently considered for the manned aircraft applications and therefore was not the focus of prior FCSs.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Classes A, B, and, if the UAS is operated in accordance with instrument flight rules (IFR), Class C.",,,0,,,,,,,
The proposed communication system should be designed and implemented to support a seamless integration of UAS operations into current ATC procedures while maintaining the required safety-of- flight levels.,,,1,,,,,,,
It is anticipated that in some flight conditions or in specific airspaces it could be necessary to downlink video streams.,,,1,,,,,,,
"In additional to propagation characteristics, smaller UA whose size, weight, and power (SWAP) budgets do not allow the use of satellite terminals would also benefit from a small size of omnidirectional antennas suitable for airborne use in this band.",,,1,,,,,,,
It is recommended that larger UAs be equipped with a terrestrial link capability wherever possible.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Latency will be of the utmost importance when establishing a safety case for the operation of UAs, particularly in non-segregated airspace.",,,,1,,,,,,
Hence new operational requirements for the future data link environment will also need to be developed (Ref.,,,,0,,,,,,
"When providing ATS to a UAS, this may involve the relay of communication and execution instructions to and from a remote pilot; however, operational performance requirements between an ATSU and an UAS remain the same as those between an ATSU and any manned aircraft.",,,,1,,,,,,

"Due to changes in the proposed European partners’ schedule, some of the activities planned to be completed and detailed in this document were not included in this task.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Specifically, further interference analysis and the development of a joint interference testing program have been postponed until corresponding European L-band activities resume.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Consequently, further interference studies and technology analysis are required to assure compliance with this requirement.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Because of fewer VHF spectrum depletion concerns in the United States than in Europe for A/G communications, L–DACS development in the United States was determined to be a lower priority compared with the other future communications components, with L-band technology mainly considered to support far-term applications.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Because system capacity and spectrum saturation in the VHF aeronautical communications band appears to be a more pressing issue in Europe, the need for an L-band system is more prevalent in that region.",,,,1,,,,,,
Several L-band technologies were identified as candidates to support future en route communication due to favorable propagation characteristics and because of spectrum congestion in the VHF band.,,,,1,,,,,,
None of the considered technologies were fully recommended primarily due to concerns about the operational compatibility (spectrum interference) with existing systems in the L-band and/or because of lack of sufficient technical maturity.,,,,1,,,,,,
The L–DACS1 option represents the state of the art in the commercial developments employing modern modulation techniques and may lead to utilisation/adaptation of commercial products and standards.,,,,1,,,,,,
Therefore there is the need to validate the theoretical findings and confirm expected performances using real equipment (Ref.,,,,0,,,,,,
"In line with the AP–17, follow-on activities to further characterize the proposed L–DACS options, validate their performance, and lead to a single technology recommendation for the L-band (Ref.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Furthermore, it recommended making final technology selection in coordination with other regions by 2010, to allow the development of the technical specifications for inclusion in ICAO SARPs and Manuals.",,,,1,,,,,,
"To complete the selection of the L–DACS, the detailed specifications for L–DACS1 and L–DACS2 were to be developed in 2009 along with interference scenarios, compatibility criteria, and a testing plan.",,,,1,,,,,,
"These activities were proposed to be followed by SESAR joint undertaking (JU) prototype development, testing, and evaluation in to assess the overall performance of L–DACS1 and L–DACS2 systems.",,,,1,,,,,,
During the second phase data communications is to become the primary means of A/G communication supporting increased automation in the aircraft and on the ground.,,,,1,,,,,,
The L-band system is proposed to be introduced during the second phase of FRS implementation.,,,,1,,,,,,
"However, transition issues need to be identified early in the system development process to assure they are properly addressed by the time of system deployment.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Because the system will be implemented after many other NextGen components are already in place (e.g., DataComm and C-band aeronautical mobile airport communications system, or AeroMACS), it will have an advantage of benefiting from the work and lessons learned during prior transitions.",,,,1,,,,,,
The NextGen Task Force is focusing on the difficult transition issues that must be addressed to achieve the goals of improving the performance of the NAS while transitioning to NextGen.,,,,1,,,,,,
"This will require us to address policies, procedures, operational approval processes, certification, regulatory guidance, training, criteria and standards—along with technology.",,,,0,,,,,,
"We have a plan; now it is time to begin the really difficult work of execution, which is much more difficult than planning because it requires commitment to action.",,,,1,,,,,,
A final selection of services chosen as applications for the new system will greatly influence transition time and process.,,,,0,,,,,,
"When implemented, the system will provide a long-term capacity solution and will allow the introduction of new communications services.",,,,1,,,,,,
A gradual transition to the new band and services will lead to mixed equipage aircraft cooperating for extensive periods of time.,,,,1,,,,,,
Thus an evolutionary process is possible without mandating migration of existing UAS operations to the new bands and transmission systems as they become available.,,,,0,,,,,,
"If an evolutionary process is chosen, some communications technologies could be made available for UAS operations quickly while others are being developed.",,,,1,,,,,,
A/A communications is shown as being provided on L-band only.,,,,1,,,,,,

"A combination of selecting B–AMC channels with a certain frequency offset from nearby DME systems, and ensuring that a minimum separation distance is maintained to allow avoiding causing interference to DME, SSR, and UAT.",,,,1,,,,,,
"When selecting appropriate centre frequencies for the B–AMC system, all interferers with the power level below –100 dBm can be neglected.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Moreover, the interference situation in each channel can be simplified to one representative interferer with representative power and duty cycle, hence facilitating the ranking of different candidate centre frequencies with respect to interference condition.",,,,1,,,,,,
"As it is not clear whether benefits of OFDM on the reverse link overweigh the need for a highly linear airborne power amplifier, it is recommended to examine methods to reduce peak-to-mean ratio of OFDM in the reverse link (e.g., by using a single carrier FDMA or a similar technique).",,,,1,,,,,,
"As the En-Route coverage is the most demanding case with respect to the usage of spectral resources, this case has been investigated in detail—TMA and airport planning have been delegated to the future work.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Within the initial planning exercise, large 120 nm En-Route B–AMC cells have been considered, with ground B–AMC TX power of +38 dBm.",,,,1,,,,,,
"As expected, simultaneously considering the interference from the B–AMC GS [ground station] towards airborne DME receivers and the interference from DME GSs towards airborne B–AMC receivers have imposed strong restrictions upon the pool of available B–AMC frequencies.",,,,1,,,,,,
"In the consequence, for some B–AMC cells an appropriate B–AMC inlay frequency could not be found (at least not without re-arranging DME allocations).",,,,0,,,,,,
"Common assumptions, metrics, and interference criteria for both candidate technologies should be established and followed to enable an objective comparison between them.",,,,1,,,,,,
It is recommended that further evaluation on the impact of L–DACS transmissions on the incumbent L-band system receiving systems be performed when the L–DACS design has sufficiently matured.,,,,1,,,,,,
System specification studies capture the parameters relevant for the prototype development.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Continued research, development and testing activities closely coordinated between EUROCONTROL and FAA will allow realization of desired system capabilities while adhering to the strictest safety and security requirements.",,,,1,,,,,,
It is assumed that the L–DACS could enable transfer of data and information from ground locations to an aircraft prior to landing to facilitate movement on the surface.,,,,1,,,,,,

Included is a discussion of the tasks required to increase the scope of the requirements defmition and recommendations for follow-on research.,,,,,1,,,,,
"In addition, advances in the development of distributed and parallel processing systems necessitate the careful allocation of processing tasks among the system’s computing resources in order to realize the increased system performance, reliability, and flexibility that these architectures offer.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Consequently, an effective systems engineering analysis is required to first identify the system requirements.",,,,,0,,,,,
"A good requirements analysis addresses a system’s true requirements, that is, those essential features or capabilities that a system must possess in order to fulfill its purpose, regardless of how the system is implemented.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The objective of this work was to analyze the NASA Transport Systems Research Vehicle (TSRV) flight control system (FCS) and develop a system specification that would offer high visibility of the essential system requirements in order to facilitate the future development of alternate, more advanced software and hardware architectures.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Neither the original (i.e., essential) TSRV FCS requirements nor the evolution of the baseline software are well documented, thus the “essence” of the system was backed out of the existing implementation.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Consequently, the specification produced is more influenced by the particular design preferences than would be a “top down” analysis for the development of an all new system.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Furthermore, because the analysis was of an existing system, the scope of the requirements were limited to only those features actually implemented in the code.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Furthermore, for this report, the teamwork data representing the TSRV FCS requirements analysis were reformatted into a single, unified, object-oriented specification.",,,,,1,,,,,
Hardware and software descriptions are included below only to provide a general overview of the system.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Norden #1, the Displays host computer, interprets input information from Norden #2 as well as from the sensors to create data blocks that are sent to a microprocessor-based Sperry Color Display System which provides the primary Right, Navigation, and Engine Display formats.",,,,,1,,,,,
"For the purposes of this report, the TSRV FCS is defined by the “baseline” software for the TSRV research flight deck including all navigation, guidance, and control functions, and primary pilot displays.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Consequently, some inconsistencies were found during the analysis.",,,,,1,,,,,
"It is necessary to move from this nebulous condition to a more precise set of requirements, or better yet, a well-defined model of the requirements.",,,,,0,,,,,
"In the analysis stage, the specification of the system should not be influenced by past design solutions -- “We’ve always done it that way” -- or by current technology constraints such as processor speeds or memory limitations.",,,,,1,,,,,
The result is a technology dependent model of a solution to the problem.,,,,,1,,,,,
"In the case of the TSRV FCS, the systems analysis process started from a specification of the system “as built”.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Therefore, in a “reverse engineering” sense, the requirements were backed out of the existing implementation.",,,,,0,,,,,
"It unifies elements of information, behavior, and processing on an atomic level (object level), whereas structured analysis provides three hierarchical system level views which are not necessarily consistent and require parallel maintenance.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The result is a complete, consistent, and simplified description of a system’s essential requirements.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Furthermore, OOA provides a solid foundation for partitioning systems into “objects” and results in a system definition which allows a smooth transition into design.",,,,,1,,,,,
The products are the deliverable results of applying OOA to a specific system.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Therefore, each object class template is comprised of three class level models: a Data Model; 2) a Process Model; and 3) a Behavior Model.",,,,,0,,,,,
"In order for an object to be a member of a given class, it must conform to the class’ template: that is, it must be &scribed by the prescribed data, it must do the prescribed work (processing), and it must exhibit the prescribed behavior.",,,,,1,,,,,
"An event is a circumstance, occurrence, or happening which may cause a change in the state of an object.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In the analysis phase, every object class must either be described by data, process, and behavior models, or be designated as an external object class.",,,,,1,,,,,
"With this strategy, the analyst focuses frrst on the information aspect of a system in order to discover as many of the object classes as possible.",,,,,1,,,,,
The result of this activity is a fmt approximation of the OCRM along with Data Models for each of the object classes found so far.,,,,,1,,,,,
They allow description in both functional and object- oriented analysis.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Consequently, various conventions were developed to adapt teamwork to the OOA methodology.",,,,,0,,,,,
"When reviewing the requirements specification given in Section 6, it may be helpful to know beforehand some details regarding the conventions that have been followed.",,,,,1,,,,,
"For this reason, notation that has been published and is generally known is not explained.",,,,,0,,,,,
"For example, one naming convention that required object class names to contain parentheses and spaces made it difficult to navigate within the software and eliminated any chance of producing an error report.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Consequently, various conventions were developed to adapt teamwork to the Boeing OOA methodology.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Others are Boeing-developed, and have enabled the recording of essential information in an OOA specification that is not directly supported -- and therefore not expected -- by teamwork.",,,,,0,,,,,
The following paragraphs are &signed to allow the reader of the specification to extract important information at a glance.,,,,,1,,,,,
The dash (‘-’) is used only when explicitly required by these conventions, it is not used otherwise.,,,,,1,,,,
"Teamwork, however, considers the name of the thing to be the full string of characters, and is thus unaffected by the augmentation.",,,,,1,,,,,
"When several attributes form the primary id, each attribute is separated by a plus sign (""+""), and should appear on a line of its own; the last attribute may be followed by a period (""."").",,,,,1,,,,,
"Comment blocks, if present, are delineated with a begin and end asterisk (""*',).",,,,,1,,,,,
"If so, these are indicated using the format shown above.",,,,,0,,,,,
"Please note that the attribute list which appears inside the rectangle of a given object class on the Object Class Relationship Diagram (OCRD) is enclosed in a comment block -- it has been entered manually, and teamwork has not checked for agreement between this list and the list which is part of the object’s definition.",,,,,1,,,,,
"It may help to know this in case a subsequent change is required, or an inconsistency should arise.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Common domains are created whenever two or more attributes share a common domain of values, due to an essential similarity (not a coincidence).",,,,,1,,,,,
"This is done to follow the guideline, “Document each fact in just one place.” In these cases, the group of similar attributes simply reference the common domain definition by its name, rather than repeat the shared domain specification.",,,,,0,,,,,
Attributes which reference other definitions are said to have nonprimitive definitions.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Derived attributes are identical to (regular) attributes except in an information modeling (data normalization) sense: they represent not stored data, but data derived from a process.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The process which derives a particular derived attribute may be explicitly defined for clarity or use in the Behavior Model, but is often left as an implied, always-available process.",,,,,1,,,,,
The description of an event captures the precise meaning of the event when it occurs.,,,,,1,,,,,
It is a consequence of the above naming convention that a global dictionary immediately after listing the object class.,,,,,1,,,,,
"This considerably improves the readability and usefulness of such a printout, and aids the analysis process.",,,,,0,,,,,
This simply improves readability by markedly distinguishing an ADCEP name from an object class name (entered in all capital letters).,,,,,1,,,,,
"For example, the reader immediately knows that the attribute “wfp-l-Flight-- Plan-Name-RO1 A” is a referential attribute, because it has the ‘R’ tag “ROl A”.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Specifically, the reader sees that relationship “RO1” is referenced, and that the object class connected to line “ROl A” is the object class from which the attribute comes.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Therefore, the reader knows that the attribute “wfp-1-Flight-Plan-Name-ROlA” is in an essential sense equivalent to one of the attributes from the object class “FP--Flight-Plan”.",,,,,1,,,,,
The description for an ADCEP may be omitted where obvious from the name.,,,,,1,,,,,
The ADCEP’s domain specification (if any) is enclosed in a rectangle indented from both margins about 1 inch.,,,,,1,,,,,
Teamwork checks referenced ADCEPs when validating a nonprimitive definition.,,,,,1,,,,,
"When two or more ADCEPs are referenced, this indicates that the ADCEP is actually composed of two or more meaningful parts, each with its own domain.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Common domains are created whenever two or more ADCEPs share a common domain of values, due to an essential similarity (not a coincidence).",,,,,1,,,,,
A primitive definition is one that does not reference other ADCEPs, its domain (if any) is explicitly stated via a domain specification.,,,,,1,,,,
"The format of the domain specification varies, depending on the kind of domain being described: enumeration, subtype indication, string, numeric, or integer.",,,,,0,,,,,
"An attribute in a supertype which names the subtype object class is called a subtype indication, and its domain of valid values is, by definition, the object ids of the subtype object classes.",,,,,1,,,,,
"An ADCEP whose domain of valid values is strings of characters may be defined by a maximum size, minimum size, legal characters and/or format (if any).",,,,,1,,,,,
The description of a string ADCEP may have to include an English description of its required format in order to be precise.,,,,,1,,,,,
A transition is a change from one state to another state due to a particular event.,,,,,,1,,,,
Transition labels have been augmented in several ways in order to simplify otherwise busy STDs.,,,,,,1,,,,
"A standard STD (i.e., a standard OOA STD) modified according to these conventions will generally have fewer transition lines and/or fewer state boxes.",,,,,,1,,,,
A slash (“/”) and a separator line follow the event block whenever a guard and/or response follow.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The guard, when present, is always preceded and followed by a separator line, and always appears before the response (if any).",,,,,,1,,,,
"The response, when present, always appears last, below a separator line.",,,,,,1,,,,
A transition which has a boolean expression in its event block is referred to as an evaluated transition.,,,,,,1,,,,
"When more than one item is listed, the transition is taken to be a shorthand for a set of transitions (one for each item) which share the same source state, next state, guard and response.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The event name carries the usual meaning: when an object of the class is in the source state, and the named event occurs, then the transition will be taken (unless the transition’s guard is false -- see below).",,,,,,1,,,,
The boolean expression becoming true while the object is in the source state is treated as an event in the usual sense.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Upon entry into a state which contains one or more evaZuuted transitions, each of the boolean expressions must be evaluated (in any order), and the associated transition taken immediately if the guard evaluates to true; none of the enabled processes associated with the state shall begin until after all of these boolean expressions have been evaluated as false.",,,,,,1,,,,
"When one of the events occurs, or when one of the boolean expressions evaluates to true, it is said that an event in the event block has occurred.",,,,,,1,,,,
"A transition containing a guard is r e f e d to as a guarded event transition, and cannot be taken unless the guard evaluates to true at the time an event in the event block occurs.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If the guard evaluates to false, then the transition is not taken: the event in the event block is ignored.",,,,,,1,,,,
It is pennissable for a guard to appear on a transition which has no event block.,,,,,,1,,,,
"However, in this case, the guard is treated as an event block consisting of single boolean expression.",,,,,,1,,,,
"In this case, the process is shown to produce the event by means of a dotted arrow notation.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Other than this, no special conventions were adopted for Process Model diagrams.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If the object class has a Behavior and/or Process Model, the Behavior Model Diagram and/or Process Model Diagram appear after Definitions.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If the object class has a Behavior or Process Model, su zh is indicated.",,,,,,1,,,,
This is the pilot-indicated airspeed which shall be maintained while the Airspeed-Hold_Mode_Controller is engaged.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The Altitude-Hold-Mode-Controller, when engaged, generates steering commands so as to capam and hold a pilot-selected altitude.",,,,,,1,,,,
This is the pilot-indicated altitude which shall be captured and held when the Altitude-Hold-Mode-ConController is engaged.,,,,,,1,,,,
This defines the altitude for the aircraft just when actually at the waypoint.,,,,,,1,,,,
"When fewer than four dimensions are specified, the remaining dimensions are unconstrained and are determined by the pilot or system “on the fly” during flight.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The path may contain so-called “discontinuities,” which arise due to modifications which delete part of the path.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The Manual-Electric-Mode_Controller, while engaged, provides mdimentaxy transformation of the AFD control inputs; the aimaft is essentially being flown manually.",,,,,,1,,,,
"This is the instantaneous longitudinal acceleration of the aircraft, where forward acceleration is positive.",,,,,,1,,,,
"This is the instantaneous lateral acceleration of the aircraft, where acceleration towards the right wing is positive.",,,,,,1,,,,
"This is the instantaneous ""vertical"" acceleration of the aircraft, where the vertical axis completes the right-hand coordinate system of the aircraft.",,,,,,1,,,,
This is due to the fact that the system shall give maximum flexibility to the pilot as he or she constructs a Flight-Plan.,,,,,,0,,,,
"The TPG, while engaged, generates steering commands that direct the aircraft to, and maintain it on, the time projection of the Flight-Plan.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The VFG, while engaged, generates steering commands that direct the aircraft to, and maintain it on, the vertical projection of the Flight-Plan.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If the Waypoint is &fined by the pilot via reference to existing Waypoint(s) (e+, SPO/30/30 or SPO/180/EAT/270), then the pilot-entered reference shall be used as the name.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Likewise, if the Waypoint is defined by the pilot via latitude and longitude coordinates, then these coordinates shall be used as the name.",,,,,,1,,,,
"In order to maximize the scope of analysis on this project, the development of OCCDs was given a low priority, and only an example OCCD was generated.",,,,,,1,,,,
Such requirements were captured via pseudo external object classes which serve as placeholders until they can be thoroughly analyzed.,,,,,,1,,,,

"In order to achieve community acceptance of the nomenclature presented here, the definitions are to be iterated with International LST & E Working Group (ILSTE-WG); this being a representative sample of the view of the wider data provider, LST expert, and user communities.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, liaison with the Land Product Validation (LPV) sub-group of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration and Validation (WGCV), both directly and through contacts within the ILSTE-WG aim to promote this nomenclature for inclusion in the first LPV “Best Practices Guide for LST”, which is still to be defined.",1,,,,,,,,,
"While some of these terms may be more qualitative than the more precise mathematical terminology as presented in [RD-1], their use is now so embedded in the psyche of the LST data provider and user communities it is pertinent to provide a unified definition of these terms so as to ensure consistency within this field.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Individuals who require a precise mathematical definition of thermal remote sensing properties, such as directional and hemispherical radiometric temperatures, or directional and hemispherical emissivities, are referred to [RD-2].",1,,,,,,,,,
"To further advance these common themes, a new group has been founded with the support of GlobTemperature in its first three years.",1,,,,,,,,,
To address these themes a number of task-orientated groups are being considered.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Where feasible, individuals external to the GlobTemperature Project Team from the ILSTE-WG General membership are identified and approached to review specific deliverables (deliverable sections).",1,,,,,,,,,
In the interest of international buy-in and cooperation the ILSTE-WG will also be a focus for review on other related international LST projects.,1,,,,,,,,,
"However, it must be stated that since the ILSTE-WG operates on a “best efforts” basis for most members the review of deliverables is entirely on the goodwill of international colleagues, and the maintenance and growth of the community takes priority.",1,,,,,,,,,
From this assessment a comprehensive list of user requirements for best practice in LST data provision was compiled.,1,,,,,,,,,
The User Requirements defined from the results of the User Survey have been augmented with updates following mini-questionnaires carried out during breakout sessions.,1,,,,,,,,,
Where questions did not permit different levels to be specified then requirements were considered to be at the threshold level.,1,,,,,,,,,
To assess whether a GlobTemperature requirement could be quantified then three options were available.,1,,,,,,,,,
"First, the responses were evaluated to see whether a ‘hard’ requirement could be issued on the basis of 75 % or more of participants agreeing on a particular option or where a particular specification would satisfy to whether a requirement based on a majority response could be issued.",1,,,,,,,,,
This type of requirement is appropriate where respondents could only select a single response from a range of options.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Finally, if this type of requirement could not be issued, a decision could be made to construct a ‘soft’ requirement.",1,,,,,,,,,
This type of requirement was best suited to multiple choice questions where participants could select a range of options that they felt were applicable to their use of LST data.,1,,,,,,,,,
If none of these types of requirement could be constructed then no requirement was issued.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Once a requirement was identified then it was first checked against the outcomes of the first user consultation meeting (UCM#1) for agreement, differences or contradictions.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Where a contradiction occurred, the outcomes from both UCM#1 and the current survey were weighed to construct the final requirement, which was justified in the comments section of the requirements table along with a description of the discrepancy.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Where the information was provided, the same process was reiterated with breakthrough level specifications.",1,,,,,,,,,
Provide LST users with email alerts about data availability and reprocessing.,1,,,,,,,,,
In each sub-section where the implementation of a requirement is described then this is clearly indicated to provide additional traceability.,1,,,,,,,,,
"For single-sensor datasets which explicitly exploit surface emissivity in their retrieval, such as MODIS, this will be provided as mandatory information.",1,,,,,,,,,
The choice of netCDF-4 as the format preferred by the user community allows for high-level of internal compression of datafiles with no difference in read performance to uncompressed files.,1,,,,,,,,,
"These temporary user workspaces will be created when users place bulk orders for data via the Data Portal, with files deleted after a period of two weeks.",1,,,,,,,,,
Once a dataset is released to the user community via the Data Portal any further evolution of the algorithm and re-processing will be subject to a minimum period of one month being enforced between releases.,1,,,,,,,,,
The GlobTemperature User List is being maintained as new users are both identified externally and through registration via the GlobTemperature Website.,1,,,,,,,,,
Exact individual metadata will be iterated with the ILSTE-WG to ensure all metadata requirements are covered.,1,,,,,,,,,
For global gridded datasets equal-angle (regular latitude-longitude) is more suitable for global user applications and if user demand is sufficient will be provided at a broad set of resolutions defined in Section 6.5.5 to successfully meet the wide range of user requirements.,1,,,,,,,,,
For high latitude applications then equal area projections are more suitable and as such dedicated polar IST / LST datasets will be available in these projections.,1,,,,,,,,,
Optional uncertainty information allows the Data Provider to break this down into its component elements.,1,,,,,,,,,
"For higher-level products, as well as total grid cell uncertainty, the uncertainty information can be optionally disaggregated into random, synoptically correlated, and sampling components.",1,,,,,,,,,
As stated for REQ-29-TR uncertainty information is to be provided as the value that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurand rather than as confidence levels.,1,,,,,,,,,
Such information will be averaged to Level-3 if available.,1,,,,,,,,,
Where data adjustment is performed this will be provided in the harmonised format as attribute comments.,1,,,,,,,,,
"REQ-33-TR Where available, land cover type, fraction of vegetation cover, albedo assumed in the retrieval and NDVI will be provided with LST data.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Python tools, which are platform independent, will be provided to read the LST data in their harmonised formats; such tools will allow for sub-setting.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The visualisation suite on the Data Portal will allow users to view data composited on different timescales, maps and time-series of data intercomparisons from the matchup database, and LST and LST anomalies.",1,,,,,,,,,
To ensure data file sizes remain manageable it is further proposed that all GlobTemperature data products are internally compressed to the highest level (level 9) possible (addresses requirement REQ-10-TR).,1,,,,,,,,,
There is no detriment to the performance of reading these datafiles by implementing the highest-level of internal compression, the compression of the datafiles instead only impacts the initial writing of the datafiles and is thus borne internally by the Project rather than impacting the users.,1,,,,,,,,
"The distinct features of Level-2, Level-3, Level-4 and databases for multi-sensor validation and intercomparison necessitate minor enhancement to these grouped harmonised formats, but all based on core variables and common metadata.",1,,,,,,,,,
The CF (Climate and Forecast) metadata conventions are designed to promote the processing and sharing of files created in netCDF format.,1,,,,,,,,,
"This enables users of data from different sources to decide which quantities are comparable, and facilitates (http://cfconventions.org/) [RD-19].",1,,,,,,,,,
The User Requirements (Table 4) defined from the results of the User Survey have been augmented with updates following mini-questionnaires carried out during breakout sessions thus satisfying the technical requirement GT-TS-4, these updates are recorded in Table 6.,1,,,,,,,,
"The GlobTemperature NRT Merged LST demonstration product processed at IPMA’s operational chain, archived locally and made available via FTP through the GlobTemperature portal aims to provide timeliness for new data of less than 24 hours.",1,,,,,,,,,
Once a dataset is released to the user community via the Data Portal any further evolution of the algorithm and re-processing will be subject to a minimum period of quarterly being enforced between releases.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Where the information is available, Level-2 single-sensor datasets in harmonised format will provide information on 2 m air temperature, total column water vapour, wind speed and humidity; with aerosol affected pixels as a QC flag.",1,,,,,,,,,
For time series extraction a tool will be developed tool that allows cloud filtering to provide data as both a plot and csv data file.,1,,,,,,,,,
A repository will be set up to allow users to share data reader and visualisation tools within the community.,1,,,,,,,,,
"A minimum set of required information will be requested of any user wanting to share their tools and the user must accept responsibility for ensuring the robustness, security and any licensing matters regarding the tools are satisfied.",1,,,,,,,,,
Cloud cover information provided within the QC flags of the GlobTemperature Products can be applied by the Data Portal facility prior to dissemination.,1,,,,,,,,,
This would though increase the waiting time for users to acquire the final data.,1,,,,,,,,,
Since this requires data from multiple input data streams with considerable processing requirements such timeliness is not considered feasible.,1,,,,,,,,,
"However, once data from Sentinel-3 becomes available a NRT GlobTemperature LST Product for Sentinel-3 would be feasible within the remit of a CCN.",1,,,,,,,,,
Although much of the feedback obtained during UCMs are of a qualitative nature and thus not necessarily suitable for deriving User Requirements – which then drive Technical Specifications – such feedback is nevertheless pertinent to the direction of the Project, and indeed in the methods employed to deliver the most appropriate products to maximise exploitation.,1,,,,,,,,
"As such, where possible the response to this user feedback has been enumerated as GT-UFs and addressed throughout the Technical Specifications.",1,,,,,,,,,
"It should be d, that this weighting towards this request may partially be a result of the large numbers of urban participants following on from the EarthTemp meeting.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Overall quality should be moved up in the QC since more important than the day/night flag, with a bit tool/decoder to produce a mask on the QC inserted into the extraction tool.",1,,,,,,,,,
Improved folder structure can decrease download time such as one folder per year if there is only one file per day.,1,,,,,,,,,
Enable tiles to be aggregated into a single file when multiple are selected from an ROI selection.,1,,,,,,,,,
All these instruments have used similar orbits and equator crossing times ensuring a high level of consistency - thus providing approximately 20 years of data.,1,,,,,,,,,
Continuation of this data will be sustained with the launch of the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) on board Sentinel-3.,1,,,,,,,,,
"AATSR has good radiometric accuracy of less than 0.1 K, which is achieved using Stirling Cycle coolers to maintain the infrared detectors in an optimal thermal environment.",1,,,,,,,,,
"For ATSR-1 the radiometric accuracy gradually deteriorated over the lifetime of the instrument as the detector temperatures increased, whereas for ATSR-2 good radiometric accuracy of less than 0.1 K was achieved over its lifetime.",1,,,,,,,,,
"However, no data were acquired from ATSR-2 between December 1995 and June 1996 due to the scan mirror anomaly; and the ERS-2 gyro failure in January 2001 affected the satellite's ability to maintain its normal stellar yaw-steering mode.",1,,,,,,,,,
"With a swath width of 512km, AATSR is able to provide approximately 3-day global LST coverage with a repeat cycle of 35 days.",1,,,,,,,,,
In the case of the ESA standard (A)ATSR Level-2 LST (ESA_V3) product there are 13 land biome classes and one lake class at a spatial resolution of 0.5°.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Issues relating to the auxiliary biome and fractional vegetation data utilised by the product were identified from validation, with the conclusion being that the resolution of these data were not high enough for their intended purpose [RD-23, RD-24].",1,,,,,,,,,
"As such substantial development under the ESA Long Term Land Surface Temperature Validation Project led by the University of Leicester has produced a significantly improved product (UOL_LST_2P) for AATSR [RD-16, RD-25].",1,,,,,,,,,
"In addition, the original Globcover bare soil class has been divided into six separate classes, taking the total number of land and inland water classes to 27.",1,,,,,,,,,
"To incorporate these changes the Globcover nomenclature has been replaced, with the new classification system known as the ATSR LST Biome version-2 (ALB-2).",1,,,,,,,,,
In addition to the 27 land and inland water classes an additional biome class (ALB-2 class 0) is included for completeness and represents the ocean and large lakes – this corresponds to where the AATSR land- sea mask identifies a pixel as sea – whereby SST is retrieved rather than LST.,1,,,,,,,,,
Where snow or ice is identified the pixel is reclassified as permanent ice (ALB-2 class 27) and LST is retrieved by applying the associated coefficients.,1,,,,,,,,,
The values of FCOVER are computed from leaf area index and other canopy structural variables available in the CYCLOPES (Carbon cYcle and Change in Land Observational Products from an Ensemble of Satellites) product using a neural network trained from the 1-D radiative transfer models SAIL and PROSPECT.,1,,,,,,,,,
These standard products have been consistently processed to Level-2 LST utilising this same algorithm.,1,,,,,,,,,
UOL_LST_2P has been reprocessed from the L1b data following the ATSR 3rd reprocessing.,1,,,,,,,,,
"For IST, prior knowledge of the surface type is required in order to allow selection of the most suitable retrieval algorithm.",1,,,,,,,,,
The (A)ATSR IST dataset [RD-28] applies LST coefficients to retrievals over snow and ice.,1,,,,,,,,,
These coefficients have been regressed from radiative transfer modelling of permanent snow and ice surfaces utilising associated atmospheric profile and emissivity data.,1,,,,,,,,,
Where a surface is identified as transient snow/ice or sea-ice these IST coefficients are applied instead of the respective LST or SST coefficients.,1,,,,,,,,,
The variability of surface type dictates a requirement for a dynamic mask that demarcates snow/ice- covered areas from snow/ice-free areas in addition to the usual requirements for a land-sea mask.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, it is the differentiation of ice from cloud over both land and water using the data available from the instrument channels that can be the most challenging feature of IST retrieval.",1,,,,,,,,,
"For determination of the snow mask third-party ice extent data from OSTIA is used for sea-ice extent and over the land [RD-29] is used for daytime retrievals and IMS data for land-ice extent at night; the cloud mask is then an application of the UOL_V3 cloud clearing algorithm, which has been shown to perform well [RD-30].",1,,,,,,,,,
"Earlier work [RD-31] established that LSWT retrieval using standard ATSR SST retrieval coefficients is prone, for some lakes, to retrieval biases of 0.5K.",0,,,,,,,,,
"This methodology is generic (i.e. applicable to all lakes) as variations in physical properties such as elevation, salinity, and atmospheric conditions are accounted for through the forward modelling of observed radiances.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The ARC-Lake LSWT algorithm [RD-32] uses the radiative transfer model, RTTOV8.7 [RD-33], driven by the NWP profile for the state of the atmosphere from ECMWF, to simulate top-of-atmosphere brightness temperatures for ATSR.",1,,,,,,,,,
Prior surface temperature fields (on a 1/120° grid) for the forward modelling are derived iteratively from ATSR observations using empirical orthogonal function techniques to fill in gaps in the observations (e.g. clouds).,1,,,,,,,,,
"LSWT retrievals are performed at the ATSR level-1b pixel resolution using (where possible) dual-view 3-channel for night-time and dual-view 2- channel retrievals for day-time, before being averaged onto a 0.05° grid.",1,,,,,,,,,
Lake locations have been defined using a land/water mask derived from a combination of a 1/120° global gridded binary mask (NAVOCEANO) and polygon data from the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD) [RD-35].,1,,,,,,,,,
"Although AVHRR/3 is a six-channel radiometer, only five channels are transmitted to the ground at any given time, since channels 3a and 3b do not operate simultaneously.",1,,,,,,,,,
"For Metop satellites, channel 3a is operated during the daytime portion of the orbit and channel 3b during the night-time portion.",1,,,,,,,,,
Again emissivity estimates are based on the so-called Vegetation Cover Method and atmospheric correction takes into account hourly forecasts obtained from the operational global ECMWF model.,1,,,,,,,,,
The Special Sensor Microwave / Imager (SSM/I) sensors have been on board the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) polar satellites since 1987.,1,,,,,,,,,
"It is based on a neural network inversion, trained on a large data set of simulated radiances, using real atmospheric and surface information over the globe.",1,,,,,,,,,
"In the absence of routine in situ surface skin measurements, retrieved LST values have been evaluated by comparison to the surface air temperature LSAT measured by the meteorological station network [RD-40].",1,,,,,,,,,
"After suppression of the variability associated to the diurnal solar flux variations, the LST and LSAT data sets show very good agreement in their synoptic variations, even for cloudy cases, with no bias and a global rms difference of 2.9 K. This value is an upper limit of the retrieval rms because it includes errors in the in situ data as well as errors related to imperfect time and space collocations between the satellite and in situ measurements.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Under clear sky conditions, the quality of our microwave neural network retrieval (TsMW1) is equivalent to the infrared ISCCP products, for most in situ stations, with errors ∼3 K as compared to in situ measurements.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The performance of the microwave algorithm is similar under clear and cloudy conditions, confirming the potential of the microwaves under clouds.",1,,,,,,,,,
"We showed that the LST accuracy does not depend upon the surface emissivity, as the variability of this parameter is accounted for in the processing.",1,,,,,,,,,
"SEVIRI was designed to observe an earth disk with view zenith angles (SZA) ranging from 0o to 80o, with a temporal sampling of 15 minutes.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The nominal SSP is located at 0º longitude and therefore the MSG disk covers Africa, most of Europe and part of South America.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Level 1.5 data are disseminated to users after being rectified to 0o longitude, which means the satellite viewing geometry varies slightly with the acquisition time (satellite zenith angles typically differ by less than 0.25o between consecutive observations).",1,,,,,,,,,
"LST fields are available every 15 minutes, in near real time and off-line, covering the MSG disk centred at 0º longitude and with a spatial resolution of about 3km at the sub-satellite point.",1,,,,,,,,,
"LST is obtained by correcting top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances for surface emissivity, atmospheric attenuation along the path and reflection of downward radiation.",1,,,,,,,,,
"This depends on a number of factors [RD-47]: (i) the retrieval conditions in terms of atmospheric water content and viewing geometry, since the total optical path will strongly influence the performance of the generalized split-window algorithm; (ii) input uncertainties, including sensor noise, errors in the estimation of surface emissivity and in atmospheric total water vapour obtained from ECMWF forecasts; and (iii) errors in the cloud mask used to identify clear sky pixels.",1,,,,,,,,,
"For most regions within the MSG disk these values are below 2K and pixels with error bars higher than 4K, generally near the edge of the MSG disk, are masked out.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Validation of SEVIRI LST relies on comparisons with other satellite products (e.g., MODIS) and with in- situ measurements.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The latter generally reveal root mean differences between 1K and less than 2.5 K [RD-47, RD-50], depending on the surface (better agreement is generally found for sites located in homogeneous surfaces).",1,,,,,,,,,
"Since then, the algorithm and input data were improved and therefore the LSA SAF team is planning a re-processing exercise to cover the full period of SEVIRI measurements (2003 onwards) with a single and most recent SEVIRI algorithm; the review to release the re-processed LST dataset is foreseen for the end of 2014.",1,,,,,,,,,
Each instrument provides a pair of observations each day acquiring data in 36 spectral bands: for Terra-MODIS at approximately 10:30am (local solar time) in its descending mode, and at approximately 10:30pm (local solar time) in its ascending mode, for Aqua-MODIS at approximately descending mode.,1,,,,,,,
"The large swath width of these instruments, 2330km, enables these satellites to view almost the entire surface of the Earth every day.",1,,,,,,,,,
MOD11_L2 data is available from 5th March 2000 and MYD11_L2 data is available from 4th July 2002.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The generalized split-window (SW) algorithm [RD-10], similar to the split-window method used for AVHRR data, is used to estimate LST as a linear function of clear-sky TOA brightness temperatures from bands 31 and 32 centred on 11μm and correction being made to account for the satellite viewing angle.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Observations correspond to approximately 13:30 (local solar time) in its ascending mode, and with a swath width of 3040 km it achieves global coverage every day with a repeat cycle of approximately 16 days.",1,,,,,,,,,
It has a spatial resolution of ~375 m at nadir in the Imagery Bands and ~750 m at nadir in the Moderate Bands through a system of pixel aggregation techniques.,1,,,,,,,,,
VIIRS controls pixel growth towards the edge of scan such that the pixel sizes are comparable to nadir.,1,,,,,,,,,
The aim of NPP VIIRS is to extend and improve upon the heritage of AVHRR and MODIS while providing a bridge between MODIS and the operational JPSS VIIRS.,1,,,,,,,,,
VIIRS LST algorithms use brightness temperatures measured by VIIRS IR channels processed through physical regression methods to retrieve skin LSTs.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The algorithms used in the VIIRS LST product do not require emissivity information, only knowledge of the land surface type - for which there are separate coefficients.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The temporal sampling over the disk is not homogeneous: images over North America are available at least hourly, while South America is covered every 3 hours.",1,,,,,,,,,
"From Jan 2013 onwards, IPMA is producing GOES LST in near real time, as part of Copernicus Global Land Initial Operations Service.",1,,,,,,,,,
"LST is estimated as a linear function of TTIR1 and TMIR (night) or of TTIR1 (day), using regression coefficients estimated for different classes of water vapour in the atmosphere, view angle and land cover types [RD-55].",1,,,,,,,,,
"GOES LST is estimated hourly on a pixel-pixel basis, together with an error bar which takes into account the algorithm expected uncertainty and propagation of input errors.",1,,,,,,,,,
"MTSAT is centred at 140 East, providing hourly coverage of most of Asia and Australia.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, the algorithm implemented by IPMA to produce MTSAT LST is very similar to that described above for GOES.",1,,,,,,,,,
"On the ground, the EFOV is 50 km by 50 km at nadir, and the distance between two EFOV is approximately 50 km.",1,,,,,,,,,
"IASI LST products are available at 12 km spatial resolution at the sub-satellite point, increasing to 39 km and 20 km at the swath edge in the across- and along-track directions, respectively.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The level 2 processing combines IASI data with concurrent measurements of the AVHRR, AMSU-A and MHS, which are flown together on MetOp, to aid cloud detection and the initialisation of the geophysical–parameters retrieval although IASI stand-alone processing is possible if other measurements are not available [RD-56].",1,,,,,,,,,
"After configuration of the retrieval algorithm with coefficients and thresholds adapted to the time and location of the measurements, cloudiness is determined, followed by the geophysical parameters, including LST from cloud-free scenes.",1,,,,,,,,,
"For the EOF analysis, principal component scores of the IASI radiances are computed and then input into the linear regression [RD-58].",1,,,,,,,,,
"The objective of data provision in GlobTemperature is to provide a one-stop-shop for all LST, IST, and LSWT data products.",1,,,,,,,,,
Thus third-party datasets will also be available via the Data Portal.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Since non- GlobTemperature funded international collaborators may be unlikely to be able to provide datasets in the agreed GlobTemperature harmonised format, the Data Portal will not restrict access to only datasets in harmonised formats.",1,,,,,,,,,
For such third-party datasets the Data Portal will provide a link to the external data centre and will include a descriptive page on the product metadata.,,1,,,,,,,,
"For the single-sensor LST dataset from the ATSR (ATSR-1, ATSR-2, and AATSR) series, this will be provided via the GlobTemperature Data Portal in the harmonised format (Section 6.5.1 and Section available on both the ESA archive and the CEDA archive in the UK) will be employed here for the GlobTemperature single-sensor (A)ATSR LST Product.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The harmonised format is slightly different, in terms of additional mandatory variables, from the format for UOL_LST_2P (although UOL_LST_2P was the baseline for the proposed harmonised format) since it is user-driven following the User Requirements Survey.",,1,,,,,,,,
"This is the approach, which will be implemented, where feasible, in new GlobTemperature products, and updated versions of existing GlobTemperature products.",,1,,,,,,,,
Thus a consistent approach to providing uncertainty information is the objective.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Since this product is available at level-2, having been derived from the ATSR level-1b data at this pixel resolution, where available this product will supersede the level-2 retrievals described above for UOL_LST_2P.",,1,,,,,,,,
Arc-Lake is derived (where possible) from dual-view 3-channel retrievals for night-time and dual-view 2-channel retrievals for day-time.,,1,,,,,,,,
"For any lake pixels where Arc-Lake is not available, the UOL_LST_2P retrievals for the inland water biome are to be used.",,1,,,,,,,,
The locations where Arc-Lake retrievals are derived are defined using the ARC-Lake land/water mask.,,1,,,,,,,,
The Arc-Lake dataset will continually be extended within the framework of the Globolakes Project for additional smaller lakes thus extending the LSWT data available.,,1,,,,,,,,
At each new LSWT release of GloboLakes the (A)ATSR GlobTemperature single-sensor dataset will be re-processed.,,1,,,,,,,,
"For IST, the latest developments at ULeic in (A)ATSR IST retrievals over land and sea will be exploited and will supersede the UOL_LST_2P LST data in the GlobTemperature product.",,1,,,,,,,,
In the case that the LSA SAF processing chain takes longer to commission than the expected then the option exists to process the GlobTemperature single-sensor Metop-AVHRR LST dataset on the UK CEMS facility exploiting the core processing nodes and the dedicated GlobTemperature workspace.,,1,,,,,,,,
"This means that access to these SAF products is granted to all users without a licence, without charge and (http://www.eumetsat.int/website/wcm/idc/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dDocName=PDF_LEG_DATA_ POLICY&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased&Rendition=Web.",,1,,,,,,,,
"DMI only have IPRs on the processing software that has been used to generate the data, but as long as they are not used for commercial purposes the data is available to the project without restriction.",,1,,,,,,,,
The data can be projected on another grid and a specific format if necessary.,,1,,,,,,,,
The initial neural network inversion [RD-37] requires a large range of ancillary observations that are difficult to collect on near-real time.,,1,,,,,,,,
"It was first developed to estimate the atmospheric parameters over land from microwave, and since the atmospheric signal is small as compared to the surface contribution caution was necessary.",,1,,,,,,,,
"It is based on the assumption that microwave surface emissivities are stable in space and time, and it shows limitations especially for surfaces with low emissivities.",,1,,,,,,,,
"In order to deliver uncertainty information from first principles consistent with other GlobTemperature products, such as (A)ATSR, it is necessary to derive new LST data from Level-1b radiances (MOD021KM / MYD021KM).",,1,,,,,,,,
"Providing Sentinel 3-A launches on schedule and depending on the length of the commissioning phase, then the single-sensor dataset will be added to the GlobTemperature suite in the agreed harmonised format.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The process is based on AATSR and MODIS data initially, with AATSR as the reference sensor for the system; AVHRR data will be added when available.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The second step is to use the daily merged infra-red LEO data to derive correction factors for the GEO sensors, in comparison to expectations from the validation and intercomparison, once microwave data is available.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Once the GEO data are merged, LEO data and GEO data can be merged; in areas not covered by GEO observations the following stage of the merging process is based on LEO-only data.",,1,,,,,,,,
"This product will be gap-filled, with estimated clear-sky biases, and also under-cloud LST where possible (addresses requirements REQ-27-TR and REQ-36-TR).",,1,,,,,,,,
This product will be gap-filled with estimated clear-sky biases and also under-cloud LST where possible.,,1,,,,,,,,
Since the ATSR’s are well-calibrated instruments corrections derived from cross-calibration are to be applied to the simulations in the coefficient generation process.,,1,,,,,,,,
"The size of these subsets are determined by the characterisation of the surface for each individual stations, and may range from 5 x 5 pixels up to 50 x 50 pixels to ensure a sufficient coverage to capture the variability of the land around the validation site.",,1,,,,,,,,
All orbits overpassing a given site will be extracted as subsets for matching in the GT_MDB.,,1,,,,,,,,
It is therefore important that all intercomparisons are carried out under a common framework.,,0,,,,,,,,
It is then critical that the protocol is adhered to so as to give confidence to the user that each GlobTemperature output product has undergone a standardised evaluation.,,0,,,,,,,,
"An agreed process for intercomparison is particularly important since such a process is to be carried out by different individuals within the GlobTemperature Project Team, and it is important that results are consistent and comparable.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Specifically, intercomparisons of satellite observations coincident with in situ validation sites are to be carried out by KIT under the framework of the Validation and Intercomparison Work Package; while global satellite vs. satellite intercomparisons to generate empirical corrections for developing the suite of Merged LST Products will be split between ULeic and IPMA.",,1,,,,,,,,
Once the protocol is finalised then the use of open source solutions for data extraction will also be considered (a recommended solution is GDAL (www.gdal.org)).,,1,,,,,,,,
ACRI-ST have developed several generic tools based on GDAL libraries allowing the generation of maps from sensor data dedicated to the comparison of satellite sensors.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Being a demonstrational service, the LST merged product will be generated at IPMA’s operational chain, archived locally and made available via FTP and through the GlobTemperature portal.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, some staging of data is needed, and the solution to this has been built on the UK- CEMS facility with 20 Tb of dedicated storage on the “globtemperature” workspace and access to central processing facilities to simplify the development of output datasets through code and data sharing.",,0,,,,,,,,
"The measurements must be continuous and frequent enough to allow a close temporal matching between satellite overpasses and in-situ data, i.e. in-situ data need to be available every 1-3 minutes, which will also allow daytime and night-time validation.",,1,,,,,,,,
Measuring the down-welling sky radiance allows correcting for reflected radiance contained in the radiance measured over the target.,,1,,,,,,,,
In-situ emissivities need to be determined with appropriate spatial and temporal sampling to be representative of LSE.,,1,,,,,,,,
"However, in case of changes in surface moisture LSE may need to be retrieved several times per day.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Depending on the surface type, the accuracy of in-situ LSE is usually between ±0.005 and ±0.015.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Where no in-situ emissivity data are available, the use of in-situ emissivities derived from MOD21 LSE is recommended.",,1,,,,,,,,
At night an upward viewing pyrgeometer can improve cloud-screening.,,1,,,,,,,,
Radiance-based validation offers a useful alternative to validation with in situ LST as it does not require in-situ measurements concurrent with the satellite overpass [RD-67].,,1,,,,,,,,
"The technique starts with an initial input satellite-retrieved LST value for which it simulates TOA BTs with a radiative transfer model; as inputs the model requires the - assumed to be known – LSE and (nearly) concurrent atmospheric profiles of air temperature, water vapour, and - if available - aerosols.",,1,,,,,,,,
Perturbations are then applied to the input LST value until the simulated TOA BTs bracket the BT observed by the satellite: the R-based LST (LSTR) is determined by interpolating between the bracketing LST.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Radiance-based validation requires accurate knowledge about the vertical structure of the atmosphere, in particular about the vertical profiles of air temperature and water vapour, and LSE has to be known.",,1,,,,,,,,
"For selecting locations where R-based validation is to be carried out, a key criterion is the spatial homogeneity and temporal stability of the surface in terms of emissivity.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, vertical profiles of air temperature and water vapour should be obtained from GCMs within a specified time around the satellite measurements and within a specified radius of the target area.",,0,,,,,,,,
"When the result of this ‘double-differencing test’, which was first implemented by [RD-67], is close to zero, then the atmospheric profiles can be assumed to be representative of the real conditions.",,1,,,,,,,,
"However, the accuracy of radiance-based validation still crucially depends on the accuracy of the input LSE, which must be known.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Intercomparisons facilitate the evaluation of the LST products relative consistency, which is highly important for users needing to judge the relative merit of several products.",,1,,,,,,,,
Intercomparisons are also mandatory when combining several products into a ‘best available product’.,,1,,,,,,,,
"However, product intercomparisons on their own are not sufficient for comprehensive validation since the various products could be ‘consistent’ but nonetheless biased with respect to reference data, i.e. in-situ LST.",,1,,,,,,,,
"This is achieved by re-gridding the data onto a common spatial grid by averaging all geo-referenced, cloud free pixels weighted by their respective fractional area overlap with the corresponding common grid cell.",,1,,,,,,,,
The high temporal variability of LST ensures that intercomparison of different LST products is a challenging prospect.,,1,,,,,,,,
"In order to minimise the impact on the intercomparison results, LST differences due to deviating observation times have to be minimised.",,1,,,,,,,,
This can be achieved by limiting the data to close temporal matchups, or – for intercomparisons between LEO and GEO datasets - by interpolating the GEO measurements that temporally bracket the LEO overpass time.,,1,,,,,,,
Analysing time series of satellite data over temporally stable targets allows identification of potential calibration drift or other issues with the instrument or the input data that manifest themselves over time.,,1,,,,,,,,
Time series provided at small spatial scales are subject to less spatial averaging and therefore provide more specific information with respect to temporal validation than time series of a merged global product.,,1,,,,,,,,
"While the latter is interesting independently, merged data sets tend to include a variety of instrumental issues and geophysical signals which are difficult to separate, and they are therefore less useful for validation purposes.",,1,,,,,,,,
This step is very important when analysing long time series or comparing different regions.,,1,,,,,,,,
"However, due to the limited amount of such high quality reference data, precision is usually assessed by analysing the variability of LST products over surfaces known to be homogeneous and stable.",,1,,,,,,,,
"In case such surfaces are not available, e.g. if there is a heterogeneous and dynamic vegetation cover in the target area, precision may also be quantified by evaluating the ‘smoothness’ of the time series of some geostatistical metric, g. variograms generally show significant variability (nugget) for pixels separated by very short distances.",,1,,,,,,,,
"It should be d that, while exhibiting certain similarities, these categories do not directly translate to the hierarchical validation classes as suggested previously for SST validation [RD-79] and by CEOS.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Based on the complexity of the methodology and the expected accuracy of the validation, the four validation categories are further subdivided into several classes.",,1,,,,,,,,
"For each subsequent class, one of the listed criteria can be relaxed.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, the LST uncertainties themselves need to be validated to provide further confidence to users of LST datasets.",,1,,,,,,,,
"However, the latter operates on a campaign basis and usually provides some measurements during the summer months.",,0,,,,,,,,
"In order to increase the number of primary in-situ validation sites for the purpose of GlobTemperature, additional sites were selected based on a) their long-term operational availability and their category according to [RD-5].",,1,,,,,,,,
"In practise this is unfeasible, but many satellite sensors observe the surface close to nadir (or such measurements can be selected) and, therefore, can be validated with in-situ LST from well-chosen sufficiently isotropic sites, g. sites covered by grass or sand [RD-81, RD-82].",,1,,,,,,,,
"For radiometers measuring in the atmospheric window and for a small distance between the sensor and the surface (a few 10m), atmospheric attenuation of the surface-leaving IR radiance can be neglected.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Where Tsfc is LST, ε is the channel-specific emissivity of the surface, B is the Planck function at the KT- with the KT-15’s response function [RD-18].",,1,,,,,,,,
"Depending on surface emissivity and on downwelling longwave radiance (e.g. a cold clear sky vs. a warm humid atmosphere), the reflection term in the above equation can cause differences of several degrees Celsius [RD-84].",,1,,,,,,,,
LST is obtained from KT-15 radiances by solving the above equation for B(Tsfc) and then solving the Planck function for Tsfc at the KT-15’s centre wavelength.,,1,,,,,,,,
"For meaningful comparisons with satellite-retrieved LST the land surface has to be near isotropic, since the in-situ sensors integrate over the entire lower hemisphere, whereas the satellite sensor is strongly directional (e.g. near nadir).",,1,,,,,,,,
"In order to avoid influence of the atmosphere on the broadband measurements (3-50µm), the distance between the in-situ sensor and the target has to be small, since the sensors also measure outside the atmospheric window.",,1,,,,,,,,
The long-term maintenance of the SURFRAD stations (Table 15) and selected ARM stations (Table 16) ensures good opportunity for matchups of in-situ LST with satellite LST products.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Due to the specific instrumentation at the sites, higher surface heterogeneity and/or small areas of the sites, many of the remaining ARM sites in Table 16 are less suitable for LST validation.",,1,,,,,,,,
Measurements of radiation are carried out on a large scale as part of a global observation network to detect long-term changes in the Earth's radiation budget and their impacts on climate.,,1,,,,,,,,
Only feasible matchup combinations are listed, where the orbit characteristics of two sensors are not compatible for matching LST then no entry is made.,,1,,,,,,,
For matchups between datasets with different spatial resolutions or different orbital tracks the standard spatial resolution for re-gridding is proposed as being 0.05º x 0.05º.,,1,,,,,,,,
For matchups between LEO and GEO satellites where the temporal frequency of the GEO observations are high the possibility of interpolating between bracketing GEO observations to the LEO overpass time may provide more representative matchups, only data from SEVIRI offers such potential.,,1,,,,,,,
Where available these should be supplied with the input satellite vs. satellite matchup datafiles (Section 6.5.3).,,1,,,,,,,,
"For each data set, the user will be able to consult a detailed version of the metadata.",,1,,,,,,,,
This kind of information must be given by the provider of the data set when it is included in the GlobTemperature Archive of the data portal (information often included in the header of the products).,,1,,,,,,,,
A registration procedure must be followed through a web form in order to gain access to project information and datasets.,,1,,,,,,,,
"For each order, the link between the registered user and the associated order will be stored in the database.",,1,,,,,,,,
This component has a direct access to the data sets (physical on the local storage area or virtual in the case of external storage).,,1,,,,,,,,
"In response to the order received, the data is transferred from the archive to the Download area.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Other solutions will be introduced depending on the user’s need, particularly in the case of non- interactive mode, which is a good way to include automated actions in scripts.",,1,,,,,,,,
A script will be set up on the dissemination system to automatically delete any ordered products older than 15 days.,,1,,,,,,,,
It is a useful tool in the context of a dissemination system because users may work on a region of interest (ROI).,,1,,,,,,,,
"In such a case, the specification of the coordinates can be done at the level of the interface and the extraction can be processed on the server side, before download.",,0,,,,,,,,
These plots will be self-explanatory, they will include a legend and an acknowledgement to the data sources.,,1,,,,,,,
Thus a tool for reading the harmonized formats described in Section 6.5 would be beneficial.,,1,,,,,,,,
"This requires any tool to be platform independent, with functionality for extracting subsets of data from the downloaded datafiles.",,0,,,,,,,,
Additional detailed specifications will be appended in further versions in response to the users need and to recommendations of the International LST & E Working Group.,,1,,,,,,,,
There are expected to be reservations in ensuring that the shared tools are error free, while some LST data users are likely to be unable to share tools due to copyright issues.,,1,,,,,,,
"Thus, to meet this need within the user community a tool repository area on the GlobTemperature Data Portal will be set up whereby users will be able to upload tools they are willing to share (addresses requirement REQ-42-TR).",,1,,,,,,,,
"While some basic tests can be carried out on the uploaded tools to detect viruses for example, responsibility for the integrity, security and licensing implications must reside with the user who uploaded the tool.",,1,,,,,,,,
The presence of the cloud bits within the QC flags enable easy filtering of cloud from the delivered data.,,1,,,,,,,,
"This time series extraction tool will be able to cover an entire instrument mission, although it is initially proposed to operate on single grid-cell given the huge overhead of extracting and processing datafiles for the entire archive.",,1,,,,,,,,
The parameter d resolves increases in atmospheric attenuation as the zenith viewing angle increases due to increased water vapour.,,1,,,,,,,,
"The rationale here is that the BT difference increases with increasing atmospheric water vapour, since attenuation due to water vapour is greater at 12μm than at 11μm.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Indeed, over homogeneous surfaces [RD-21] have illustrated that a dual angle algorithm may retrieve LST with more accuracy, but performance degrades as the surface becomes increasingly heterogeneous.",,1,,,,,,,,
"In addition, a physics-based day/night algorithm [RD-97] is employed to retrieve both surface spectral emissivity and temperature at 5 km resolution.",,1,,,,,,,,
"It achieves this by utilising seven MODIS TIR bands (20, rapidly than LSE.",,0,,,,,,,,
"When compared with an independent dataset of radiative transfer simulations the algorithm and it’s coefficients were found to be bias free, although random errors tended to increase with increasing water vapour content and at high view-angles [RD-50].",,1,,,,,,,,
"In comparison to SW techniques, OE methods ensure that more consideration of the true physics is considered.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Generally this ensures that the retrieved state is more likely to reproduce the observation vector when used as input in a forward model, hence provides more confidence in the result.",,1,,,,,,,,
"In this project, the single-sensor data sets disseminated via the Data Portal will continue to be produced largely with the existing algorithms because of the nature of operational systems.",,1,,,,,,,,
"This will provide information on which are the dominant sources of bias, which components are due to the algorithms, and which are due to “auxiliary” information, thus allowing a better understanding of the algorithms to develop.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The standard ESA ATSR LST algorithm (ESA_V3_algm) is not considered a potential candidate algorithm since studies [RD-16, RD-68] have illustrated the significant improvement in accuracy and precision of the UOL_V3_algm compared to the ESA_V3_algm.",,1,,,,,,,,
The comprehensive Climate Data Record Trade-off Analysis is being delivered as a separate report (LST CDR Algorithm Trade-Off Analysis (DEL-8)) [AD-5] and thus only summarised here.,,1,,,,,,,,
For global production of a CDR several techniques may be employed to decouple surface emissivity and surface temperature.,,1,,,,,,,,
"The most widely used are: the Day/Night method, which require acquisitions twice per day and assumes that day/night emissivity differences are negligible; the Temperature Independent Spectral Indices (TISI) method, which provides relative emissivity values; the Temperature and Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm, which requires multispectral thermal infrared data (TIR); and methods based on retrieval from vegetation indices, such as the NDVI THresholds Method (NDVITHM) [RD-102].",,1,,,,,,,,
The additional thermal infrared (TIR) channels of MODIS permit a choice of algorithms to be exploited.,,1,,,,,,,,
For the Prototype Sentinel-3 LST Product similar arguments are applicable as for the LST CDR Algorithm Trade-Off Analysis (DEL-8) [AD-5].,,1,,,,,,,,
"However, the SEN4LST Dual-Angle algorithm (S4L_DA_algm) is also a viable option since this is a single-sensor algorithm for an instrument with both nadir and oblique views.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Finally, the optimal estimation / 1D-var approaches, which are a very different alternative to the coefficient based algorithms in that they provide fits to the observed radiances within the constraints of the system, may be considered during the merged LST NRT activities where climate accuracy and stability may be less important.",,1,,,,,,,,
This is particularly important in the post-GlobTemperature era where continuing development of this Group may be sustained by various inter-agency funding streams.,,1,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, in addition to the invitation pack sent out to prospective members of the ILSTE-WG a tailored presentation has also been compiled for NASA Headquarters in order to gain high level support for the Group.",,1,,,,,,,,
"The ILSTE-WG will manage Technical Advisory Groups to support the development and use of satellite LST information, to promote scientific insight and innovation, to identify best-practices, and to facilitate the transfer of new science into user's applications.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Where available in the source data for a given data stream optional fields will be supplied as mandatory in the corresponding output product, albeit in accompanying auxiliary datafiles (addresses requirement REQ-33-TR).",,1,,,,,,,,
To meet the user needs of a harmonised format (REQ-16-33: Establish a single file specification covering all metadata requirements) a distinction needs to be made between the tier of data this refers to.,,1,,,,,,,,
"While both formats are to be netCDF-4 with common CF-compliant metadata (addresses requirement REQ-34-TR) and the majority of variables to be common, several differences due to the individual requirements of swath / gridded datasets are necessary.",,1,,,,,,,,
"For example, the standard Level-3 resolution for single-sensor datasets, the merged LST products, and the (A)ATSR LST CDR has been chosen to be 0.05° equal-angle daily data (with day and night distinguished); experience from GHRSST and SST_CCI informs that this is optimal and allows aggregation to many of the coarser spatio-temporal scales.",,1,,,,,,,,
"To facilitate optimum user uptake of the GlobTemperature products in harmonised format a set of tools will be developed in Python, which is open-source and platform independent software for reading and sub-setting the datafiles created in the harmonised formats.",,1,,,,,,,,
This will ensure the minimum datafile size for a given sensor is not restrictive to wide user uptake.,,0,,,,,,,,
"For optional fields, where information is available for the given sensor then these are to be provided as mandatory fields in the accompanying auxiliary datafiles (labelled AUX).",,1,,,,,,,,
Where emissivity data are explicit these can be provided in the AUX datafiles.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Thus users will not be affected by reading highly compressed datafiles, while benefitting from much reduced datafile sizes.",,,0,,,,,,,
"Data Providers are to be tasked with providing all mandatory fields in their input satellite LST extractions over each validation site, and if exists accompanying optional fields.",,,1,,,,,,,
"All mandatory fields are to be filled for each validation site, and if exists accompanying optional fields.",,,1,,,,,,,
"To facilitate detailed analysis of the differences between satellite LST data from matchups in terms of orography or land cover for example, a static / semi-dynamic (yearly updated) datafile is to be available to maintain such global information (Table 30).",,,1,,,,,,,
It is also the intention to assign Quality Flags to the LST products at a per-pixel level similar to those used for SST in the GHRSST convention to enable users to be more informed when filtering data.,,,1,,,,,,,
This agreement for these Quality Flags needs to be made in consultation with the ILSTE-WG so as to set a community standard that can be adopted by other data providers.,,,1,,,,,,,
The file length is thus consistent between the different types of datafiles ensuring maximum ease of use for the users of harmonised format products.,,,1,,,,,,,
Following feedback and interactions from the 2nd User Consultation Meeting this section will be updated with a further release of the User Case Study Work Plans prior to their commencement when a more complete picture of the available GlobTemperature output datasets is known and hence the work to be carried out can thus be more accurately organised.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Satellite data can be used to augment station data sets, providing detailed spatial pattern information for surface temperature, and observations where in situ stations are absent.",,,1,,,,,,,
"However, before any synergistic use of these different data sets can be properly developed, work must first be carried out to understand the relationships between these observation types, which although physically related, are fundamentally different.",,,1,,,,,,,
"We will do this in selected regions where there is a high-density network of stations, for example in Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and parts of the US.",,,1,,,,,,,
"A pre-processing of the L2P sea and ice surface temperature observations from GlobTemperature will be performed, where the GlobTemperature products are blended with IST observations from Metop_A, to produce a year of daily level 4 SST + IST fields, suitable to be ingested into the HYCOM-CICE model.",,,1,,,,,,,
DMI has vertical temperature measurements derived from 8 ice mass balance buoys that were deployed in 2012.,,,1,,,,,,,
The daily IST fields will be available in Netcdf format to other partners within the GlobTemperature project after generation.,,,0,,,,,,,
"The IST has a large diurnal variability that very likely exceeds the differences between observations and modeled IST, therefore and in addition to the daily observed IST maps from GlobTemperature the diurnal variations will be used to form a series of fields that includes these variations.",,,1,,,,,,,
The temperature profiles from the buoys and the two simulations will be calculated and the differences will be analyzed.,,,1,,,,,,,
"The recent retreating sea-ice cover has increased the commercial interest of these remote areas during the last decade due to potential new ship routes, increased tourist cruises and oil exploration.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Consequently, the need for trustworthy forecasts of atmospheric and oceanographic conditions is highly needed for safely marine operations in ice-covered seas.",,,1,,,,,,,
The upper boundary is called “dry edge” that represents dry soils and stressed vegetation where evapotranspiration (ET) does not occur and hence surface temperature is maximum.,,,1,,,,,,,
The “wet edge” establishes the lower boundary that corresponds with wet soils and unstressed vegetation where ET occurs near its potential rate and thus surface temperature is minimum and close to the air temperature.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Once the triangles are calculated, results will be checked to remove those dates where the LST-VI triangle is not properly defined.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Due to the linear downscaling approach, bias in SMOS SM will also be transferred to the downscaled product, nevertheless, it is expected a higher agreement of the downscaled SM than with the original SMOS resolution.",,,1,,,,,,,
Satellite LST observations will then be assimilated into the Met Office land data assimilation scheme and an assessment of the impact to both land surface analyses (soil moisture and temperature) and atmospheric forecasts will be made.,,,1,,,,,,,
Because of the recent improvements to both the modelling of the land surface and assimilation at the Met Office the source of the satellite data will need to be from a recent observing period.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Work is needed to adapt the current software (in Fortran 2003) to ingest the GlobTemperature product, including mapping the product to forecast model gridpoints, thus ensuring uniform coverage.",,,1,,,,,,,
Once a dataset is released to the user community via the Data Portal evolution of the algorithm and further re-processing will be carefully managed.,,,1,,,,,,,
Users will be updated via email on release of new and re-processed datasets.,,,1,,,,,,,
For current satellite data sources the timeliness of new observations will be 7 days once the final version of the given dataset has been released to the Data Portal for user dissemination (see Table 37).,,,1,,,,,,,
"Such level of detail, whereby types of users are categorised, is required to enable a more tailored approach to interacting with the user community.",,,1,,,,,,,
Where possible a mechanism will be explored through the ILSTE-WG for data providers and users to share visualisation and analysis tools.,,,0,,,,,,,
Where possible a mechanism will be explored for data providers and users to share reading and sub-setting tools.,,,0,,,,,,,
"Where these lie outside the scope of the project, they are nonetheless recorded in the GlobTemperature UCM Reports [AD-7], but not transformed into specifications.",,,1,,,,,,,
"In addition to proper instrumentation and calibration, a key element in defining the different levels was the availability of multi-year time series of radiometer data, since long and consistent time series are becoming increasingly valuable, not only for allowing a significantly increased number of satellite vs. in situ matchups for better statistical analysis, but also for better identification of instrumental issues such as drift.",,,1,,,,,,,
"If the outcome of such an analysis is positive, it is likely that USCRN data can be classified in one of the higher classes in future.",,,1,,,,,,,
"It has been shown that the air temperature and ground surface temperature are almost the same during certain hours of the night and that air temperature can thus be used as a surrogate dataset to validate LST as a first approximation if the satellite overpass occurs temporally close to those times (Prata, 2003).",,,1,,,,,,,
The combination of a line-by-line radiative transfer code together with a radiosonde-based atmospheric profile provides the highest possible level of accuracy for this type of LST validation.,,,1,,,,,,,
"As such, this validation class is expected to provide the lowest level of validation accuracy; however it is still a very valuable validation method when no ground LST measurements are available.",,,1,,,,,,,
"As such, this accuracy class encompasses LST inter-comparisons of datasets that deviate in their respective matchup times by more than the recommended threshold.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Aircraft equipped with radiometers are a powerful tool for validating both TOA radiances and LST derived from spaceborne instruments, as they provide much higher spatial detail than satellite data.",,,1,,,,,,,
"However, due to the episodic nature of such campaigns and the resulting lack of operational availability, data acquired in airborne LST campaigns does not fulfil one of the criteria listed above and thus is classified as a Class 2 inter-comparison.",,,1,,,,,,,
"This follows the idea that localized time series will be able to be interpreted more easily than global time series, as the latter usually combine a whole number of artificial and natural issues and thus make the identification of individual instrument problems or similar validation issues very challenging.",,,1,,,,,,,
It will do so by enabling end users to connect to the system all kind of input and output devices and smart objects.,,,1,,,,,,,
Sensors can sample data periodically (eg: sound recording) or trigger events when a given condition is met.,,,1,,,,,,,
These can be used to play a given sound when a certain message is received.,,,1,,,,,,,
"When the presence and identity of people and objects matters but their exact location does not, then the identification process appears.",,,1,,,,,,,
It uses information in the link and adaptation layers to compress network- and transport-layer headers.,,,1,,,,,,,
"DASH7's range of more than 1 kilometer (433Mhz), multi-year battery life, and ability to penetrate walls and water make it preferable in several WSN applications.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Because every INSTEON devices are flat, they do not require network supervision (network controllers and routing tables are not required).",,,1,,,,,,,
Since UWB operates at very high frequencies it has very high penetration loss which will significantly affect the performance and size of the network nodes.,,,1,,,,,,,
That is because its good standardized status and low price of the simplest units.,,,1,,,,,,,
"The range of operation is very limited, about 10 centimeters (via magnetic field induction), which allows high density of objects in a given space so that they do not interfere with each other [18].",,,1,,,,,,,
We consider that it is relevant to seamlessly compare the main well know wireless communication standards since it is important to get an idea of which of them we are going to use in the DiYSE scenarios.,,,1,,,,,,,
"With a growing selection of wireless networking alternatives, users are no longer confined to wired installations, and with cost-effective and reliable wireless products emerging based on global standards, users are no longer restricted to proprietary wireless approaches.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Since proprietary systems are usually customized to their application, they can offer benefits in transmission range, very low power consumption and per unit cost.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Since Bluetooth, ZigBee, 6LoWPAN, Wi-Fi and others use the 2.4GHz band, the coexistence issue between these standards must be dealt with.",,,1,,,,,,,
DNS in particular is interesting because it allows to record service and device descriptions along with addressing information.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Different applications can make use of different naming schemes, so that naming hierarchies can reflect the logic of an application.",,,1,,,,,,,
This means that it become possible to use different criteria for addressing a device.,,,1,,,,,,,
"For instance, if a device implements a SOAP stack and is reachable as a HTTP server, it may have a PTR record under the name _http._tcp.domainname.org.",,,,1,,,,,,
"In case of devices that are not directly connected to an IP network, this record will contain the address of the gateway through which it is possible yto reach the device.",,,,1,,,,,,
This is useful whenever a device exposes more than one interface.,,,,1,,,,,,
Applications that are based on onthologies could store links to their OWL descriptors.,,,,1,,,,,,
DPWS: Device Profile for Web Services is a set of specifications that enables devices to embed web service interfaces on them.,,,,1,,,,,,
Dynamic DNS: It is possible to dynamically send updates to the DNS server(s) whenever the situation of the internal network changes.,,,,1,,,,,,
Devices that do not have direct access to an IP network will need to be accessible through a gateway.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Instead, protocols that are based on multicast discovery schemes like DPWS need to provide a way to propagate multicast messages outside the internal network.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Finally, if REST is adopted, it become possible to create applications that do not need to rely on presence information.",,,,1,,,,,,
"It is also possible to express presence as a resource, if needed.",,,,1,,,,,,
This is because the protocol adopted to send these information have inherent issues in sending large blocks of data.,,,,0,,,,,,
Approaches such as REST allow a resource or device to provide a link to its description in the device state itself.,,,,0,,,,,,
The Devices description working group has developed a core vocabulary to adapt content in Mobile Web.,,,,0,,,,,,
"When an IP network is set up, it is possible to retrieve data from and manipulate devices through their IP interfaces.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Whenever devices do not support IP, it is necessary that a gateway in between the devices and IP networks understands and converts information between the two interfaces.",,,,1,,,,,,
If the data from the sensors are tunneled to the IP entity as they are they may contain ZigBee-specific information (like the strength of the radio signal) which are “just there” although they may not be related with the measurement data at all.,,,,1,,,,,,
"This would require applications to be able to handle transport-specific data, and it should be avoided or the application would lock into that transport technology (ZigBee in this case).",,,,0,,,,,,
"In general, pollution of the application space should be avoided especially when devices from different networking technologies are expected to communicate together (they will usually do that, either directly or indirectly through an IP network).",,,,1,,,,,,
At the IP level it is possible to use several protocol to exchange data and control information.,,,,1,,,,,,
SIP: the SIP protocol is ideal whenever data must be acquired in a conversational manner.,,,,1,,,,,,
"The SIP URL of a given stream could, if not previously known, be registered under a DNS name using a DNS TXT record.",,,,1,,,,,,
The XMPP protocol is ideal when data and control data structures are sent using messages.,,,,1,,,,,,
"XMPP URLs resemble those of emails, and, like emails, it is possible to keep messages in a storage memory when an endpoint is offline.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Therefore XMPP is better suited for loosely-coupled interaction, where device control may happen asynchronously.",,,,0,,,,,,
In case SOAP is used a device will expose its interface through a description language called WSDL.,,,,1,,,,,,
This description language relies on XSD (XML Schema Definition) in order to describe the structure of the data that can be exchanged with a device.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Given the client-server nature of SOAP, it is ideal for devices that can behave like servers, meaning that have a very high availability and are capable of servicing a great amount of traffic.",,,,1,,,,,,
"However, given the faulty nature of hardware, SOAP clients should not assume the services to be always up and running, and provide a buffer solution for downtimes.",,,,1,,,,,,
"REST: With REST, it is possible for every device to maintain its own resources inside the network, and to store its exported data over there.",,,,1,,,,,,
This has the advantage that data is available even when a device is offline.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Likewise, control information could be put inside a resource by a device-controlling application, and have the device periodically read them (or being notified through HTTP Server Push), especially after it goes online.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Therefore REST is a compelling solution when having to manage loosely-coupled systems, where the different system components and devices have different uptimes.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This enables entities to understand whether a message is original or fake, and to protect messages with a varying degree of protection.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This allows devices to check whether a request message is coming from a trusted source, and if that source has the rights to ask that request to be performed.",,,,0,,,,,,
"However, this requires the gateway to act as a simple tunnel for the data packets, which means that there is the risk of polluting the application space with device-dependent data.",,,,0,,,,,,
"In fact most of them have limited memory and processing power, meaning that supporting encryption at the native level is not always possible.",,,,1,,,,,,
"However, the problem could be mitigated if wired networking is used and the wired network is situated at a secure location.",,,,1,,,,,,
"This implies that security at the native level would require additions to existing standards, which may be impractical, especially for the sake of interoperability.",,,,0,,,,,,
Devices could communicate between entities using different networking protocols only if a protocol translation occurs.,,,,1,,,,,,
"However, given the sheer number of connecting technologies, it is not scalable to think in terms of protocol-to-protocol conversion.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Simple and inexpensive objects, as WSN devices are, will not be equipped with large-scale active intelligence, so the data they produce and the communication methods they use to transmit the data are also relatively simple.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Objects may transmit information between similar kinds of objects quite easily, but when data needs to be transferred upstream into real Internet or through another neighbour network, it is not feasible to make every object handle all the burden of the TCP/IP stack, to give an example.",,,,1,,,,,,
"On the other hand, if we desire to merge two wireless networks in order they can cooperate (e.g. interconnect WSNs with the Internet), there are many approaches in the literature that have proposed solutions.",,,,1,,,,,,
Modified TCP allows running TCP/IP protocol suite directly in the WSNs [54].,,,,0,,,,,,
"In order to avoid this issue, the referred nodes have substantial processing capability in the aggregate, but not individually, so we must combine their many vantage points on the physical phenomena within the network itself.",,,,1,,,,,,
"On the other hand, by using the combined information, the virtual sensors have also the capability of reasoning by using fusion techniques5.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Even more, the supposed actor should not need to get into the room to retrieve the referred information and therefore it should not have the necessity of discover every sensor instance within the room since the virtual sensor does its best for it.",,,,1,,,,,,
"In their work, the authors provide a solution to allow for sets of heterogeneous sensors, namely CCD video cameras and WLAN 802.11b radio devices, to be integrated in order to extract biometric information (position and ID) regarding objects in a given environment of interest.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Then, they are able to fuse range information from a variety of different platforms to build a global occupancy map that represent a single collective view of the environment.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Virtual sensors can be deployed on small devices, operate independently of heavyweight infrastructure, and provide on-demand, real- time connection to information that enables users to complete their tasks quickly, safely, and with the best possible information.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The same authors in [6] and [1] define a kind of virtual sensors that abstract a set of physical sensors and the operations that are performed on them, providing a new way of extracting data from heterogeneous wireless sensors.",,,,1,,,,,,
"In [9], a set of programming abstractions that allow a programmer to interact with several nodes (specified in a declarative way) as if they were a single virtual node is presented.",,,,1,,,,,,
"That is achieved by relieving programmers from the details of data collection, allowing them to focus on the application logic.",,,,0,,,,,,
"This first technique uses the time of transmission, the known signal propagation speed and the time of arrival of such signal in order to compute the distance between two nodes in the WSN.",,,,1,,,,,,
"However the main drawback is that it is difficult to precisely record the arrival time of radio signals, since they travel close to the light speed.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Therefore, it works best with an acoustic source as is proposed in [12] and [40].",,,,0,,,,,,
To estimate the distance it computes the difference between signals arrival time.,,,,1,,,,,,
The signals propagation speed must be known but it improves upon the ToA by eliminating the need to know when the signal was transmitted.,,,,1,,,,,,
The nodes which use this method send out a signal of known strength (using the signal attenuation) and after they use the received signal strength and the path loss coefficient to estimate the distance to the known location .,,,,1,,,,,,
It does not scale well in large networks and problems may arise due to environmental conditions.,,,,1,,,,,,
Signal frequency will undergo Doppler-shift when the transmitter and receiver are moving relative to one another.,,,,1,,,,,,
The localization is hence performed by calculating the difference of the ToA of the referred signals [19][19][20] and [21] use this method.,,,,1,,,,,,
These systems are commonly used since almost all type of WSN communication standard use this carrier.,,,,1,,,,,,
"The RF is used in several estimation techniques such as the received signal strength intensity, angle of arrival, time of flight and after it is employed by triangulation to calculate the node’s position Visible light communication systems can provide solutions to the frequency band communications since light is not interfering with the crowded radio frequency band.",,,,1,,,,,,
These systems employ sound signals instead of ultrasound signal to avoid the signal attenuation.,,,,0,,,,,,
WLAN systems often use probabilistic models to mitigate such problems as is demonstrated in [29] and [30].,,,,1,,,,,,
"Because the devices use a radio (broadcast) communications system, they do not have to be in the LoS of each other and the synchronization is avoided.",,,,1,,,,,,
By reading and identifying the tags (Assuming that the readers are placed in a well known position) the distance or the placement of nodes estimation is calculated.,,,,1,,,,,,
Then a GPS receiver calculates its position by precisely timing the signals sent by the GPS satellites [36][37].,,,,0,,,,,,
"Using the distance estimation methods with different signal modalities previously sorted, it is possible to get accurate node’s location within the WSN by applying any of the next position estimation techniques.",,,,1,,,,,,
"To compute the distances to anchors, the trilateration make use of the previously reviewed distance estimation techniques.",,,,1,,,,,,
"For a 2-Dimensions space, three anchors are enough but for several localization works such [12] and [39].",,,,1,,,,,,
"When a node desires to compute its position but the anchors are not in the node’s range, it makes use of its neighbor nodes as relays to reach the beacon nodes and eventually compute its current position.",,,,1,,,,,,
"If there exist a range estimate between neighbors, use them to improve the total length of route estimation in the previously defined method (DV- Distance).",,,,1,,,,,,
"Generally, to compute the position two angles plus a distance between two well known anchors are needed (2 Dimensions - for 3 Dimensions also the azimuth is used).",,,,1,,,,,,
"Multilateration should not be confused with trilateration, which uses distances or absolute measurements of ToA from three or more anchors.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The main drawback is that this technique requires compiling a database of features, thus extensive infrastructure.",,,,1,,,,,,
It is important to remark that these three methods could be applied in any of the proposed DiYSE scenarios since most of them looks for objects or people tracking This technique is overall used in Robotics.,,,,1,,,,,,
"The major drawback of this approach is that the position estimation accrues error over time, primarily because of noisy encoder data due to uneven surfaces, wheel slippage, dust, and other factors [42].",,,,1,,,,,,
In many cases when a person or an object is located it is also identified but most of the times in an inaccurate way.,,,,1,,,,,,
There exits hence several techniques to locate and identify people and objects inside a WSN in a proper way.,,,,0,,,,,,
"There are several standard systems working in the Identification (ID) of low frequency or high frequency rates, but during the ID process, the tracked person or the object must somehow touch or be near to the reader or even insert an ID card into a reader.",,,,1,,,,,,
"In the referred systems, the targets that are being monitored are not required to perform any action during the ID process, that is, to be computationally headless [43][44][45] and [45].",,,,1,,,,,,
The new obtained data is continuously updated by using the current sensor measurements dependent of the previous ones.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Hence, it is straightforward to get the device ID since MAC addresses are unique and therefore the nodes are perfectly indentified.",,,,0,,,,,,
This section is going to cover two of these issues: the description and the storage due these two aspects are the most important ones in order to communicate the information to the application layer (WP3).,,,,1,,,,,,
In this case context tags are used to implement the context-aware technologies.,,,,0,,,,,,
"The main objective of the project is to define and implement a platform to simplify and speed up the task of developing and deploying mobile services, making it commercially feasible for the wider IT industry (not just telecom companies) to provide such services.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The context model is used to add context meaning to the raw monitoring data, and is thus a necessary element for most context-aware systems.",,,,1,,,,,,
This highly distributed characteristic introduces a great challenge for the manageability of all this information.,,,,0,,,,,,
Hence there is a need for a common context information model and a context publishing protocol.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Given the broad spectrum of research subjects in that area, we will identify the potential and the major challenges raised by its use in DiYSE applications, and analyze the associated requirements and state-of-the-art.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Distributed computing should support scalability, reliability, dependability, and heterogeneity, but this demands the careful the design under the context of resource limited devices and dynamic network topology.",,,,1,,,,,,
"In order to provide the above mentioned high level services, while providing support for the existing heterogeneity in Wireless Sensor Networks architectures, a middleware layer is required.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Also, middleware software architectures should offer mechanisms to achieve adaptive and efficient system resources use, in order to prolong the sensor network's life.",,,,1,,,,,,
A global WSN’s behavior is programmed at a high-level specification that enables node concerned about dealing with low-level.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Its main characteristic is flexibility, allowing developers to write applications in divided small modules, which are injected and distributed through the network by the system using tailored algorithms and then interpreted by the virtual machine.",,,,1,,,,,,
The use of mobile code facilitates the injection and distribution through the network and leads to application modularity.,,,,1,,,,,,
Less energy is necessary when broadcasting small modules instead of the complete application.,,,,1,,,,,,
"This approach observes the entire network as a virtual database system, offering an easy-to-use interface that permits the user extract data of interest and issue queries about the sensor network.",,,,0,,,,,,
Message-oriented middleware uses the publish-subscribe mechanism to facilitate message exchange between nodes and the sink nodes.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Therefore, it is necessary to found mechanisms in order to get context information from the environment in a structured way.",,,,0,,,,,,
"In this sense, the middleware layer in Wireless Sensor Networks has to implement some mechanisms in order to reach efficient deployments of context applications over Wireless Sensor Networks.",,,,1,,,,,,
The contextual model implemented by this proposal allows using different reasoning mechanisms like first order logic and temporal logic.,,,,1,,,,,,
"To solve the three major problems in WSNs mentioned above, a Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) was proposed in [24].",,,,1,,,,,,
This approach allows semantically tagging the sensed data from a heterogeneous distributed sensor network in order to ease the managing of contextual data in a large scale network.,,,,1,,,,,,
"In CASN, the node’s context is most important than the human context.",,,,1,,,,,,
The context interpretation is achieved by using an interpreter based on fuzzy rules called CIBFR (Context Interpreter Based on Fuzzy Rule).,,,,1,,,,,,
"By matchmaking, CASDA discovers services, which match with given service request.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Otherwise, weak WSN devices enable higher deployment densities and increase network lifetime as they are cheaper and consume less power.",,,,1,,,,,,
"By integrating devices with different resources and capabilities, a heterogeneous WSN can combine the advantages of both powerful and weak devices.",,,,1,,,,,,
New programming models are necessary to simplify WSN application development and increase overall network utility.,,,,1,,,,,,
"These services are dynamically discovered and used at run-time, enabling applications to be platform-independent and adapt to network dynamics.",,,,1,,,,,,
"While service-oriented computing is widely used on the Internet, adopting it to WSNs is non-trivial due to the extremely limited resources available and highly dynamic nature.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Therefore, service provisioning in Sensor Networks is a huge challenge.",,,,0,,,,,,
The classical SOA-based approaches are not currently feasible to be used over Wireless Sensor Networks because of the intrinsic resource limitations of that kind of technologies.,,,,1,,,,,,
"The SOA standards such as XML, HTTP, SOAP, WSDL and UDDI are majorly related with web services provisioning by using no resources-constrained computers so they are not recommended to be applied in WSN.",,,,1,,,,,,
The authors of [42] chose this methodology since the WSN development is iterative and short what suits with the agile methods.,,,,1,,,,,,
"For filtering purpose, only those services that belong to service requester category are managed.",,,,1,,,,,,
"To perform the comparison between requested and available service some factors are taken into account such service’s inputs and outputs, and required contextual information.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Services are able to maintain state, provide multiple methods, and have their own thread of control, enabling them to operate in parallel with task.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The first, ServillaSpec, is used to create service specifications and descriptions that enable flexible matching between tasks and services.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Wireless sensors networks, as the field of matures, needs support more complex applications and collaboration among them in order to provide services.",,,,1,,,,,,
"For this propose, it’s necessary more powerful programming methods, monitoring and control, both hardware and software, during its operation.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Therefore, it’s necessary to develop an environment that configures each application and the relation with the others applications that provide the service.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Due these limitations, main efforts in management procedures for sensor networks are mainly focused on monitoring and controlling tasks, in order to optimize the network operation and maintain the network performance [52].",,,,1,,,,,,
"RRP (Register mechanism Routing Protocol) [55] is a cluster-based mobile routing algorithm aimed to improve the network life-time, using for this a system’s load balancing schema, which defines a set of flooding-zones for the data forwarding decisions, in order to perform the data aggregation tasks.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The main advantages of RRP are that zone flooding ensures low message overheads, and adjusting the size of flooding zone, it ensures high reliability.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The main lacks of RRP are that it requires a GPS device attached to the sensor nodes, in order to implement the zone-flooding protocol.",,,,1,,,,,,
"To achieve the previous exposed goals, SNMS develops a gathering tree to collect network health information, introducing a minimal impact on memory and network traffic.",,,,1,,,,,,
SNMS further minimizes energy consumption merging multiple queries into a single message.,,,,0,,,,,,
"On the other hand, SNMS network management function is limited to passive monitoring only, requiring human managers to submit queries and perform post-mortem analysis of management data.",,,,1,,,,,,
"On the other hand, BOSS requires human interaction to analyze the network states, taking management actions accordingly.",,,,1,,,,,,
To interconnect different SSNs is proposed the use of gateways.,,,,1,,,,,,
The benefit of using such architectures is the deployment and maintenance facility induced by the inherent plug-and-play and self-organized nature of wireless sensor networks.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Event-centric wireless sensor networks (EC-WSNs) differ from common WSNs, where the communications are triggered either by an on-demand or a sink-based process.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Indeed, in this case, the communication is triggered only when an event is detected in the immediate sensing-range of a node.",,,,0,,,,,,
"A wireless sensor network is vulnerable due to its characteristics as an open medium, with a network topology that dynamically changes, which employs cooperative algorithms, it lacks an element for managing and monitoring the network and it also hasn’t a perimeter defence [66][68][70] clearly defined.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The security problems in a wireless sensor networks become clear with the assumption that radio links are insecure, which makes communication in wireless sensor networks insecure too.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Attacks from malicious motes that are not part of the network and try to join it without authorization, are often done applying cryptanalysis techniques and attacking physically the device.",,,,1,,,,,,
Motes are part of the network and they may attack if they have been compromised by an attacker that has manipulated them [66].,,,,1,,,,,,
"RC5 (Rivest Cipher-5) is an encryption block algorithm [73], which may be one of the cryptographic algorithms more suitable for WSN due to their good behavior in devices with low memory capacity.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Thus also studies made by our researchers [78], has been shown that the use of the AES algorithm reduces half the batteries life.",,,,,1,,,,,
The traditional DES (Data Encryption Standard) uses many computational resources and therefore it isn’t recommended [79] for use in WSN.,,,,,1,,,,,
"One of the greatest advantages is that the primitives are already included a specific operating system for wireless sensor networks, allowing developers use this type of primitive easily.",,,,,1,,,,,
TinyECC and WMECC perform for the first time deployments based in public key cryptography and introduce the concept of digital signature in devices designed for use on WSN.,,,,,1,,,,,
"However, the main disadvantage of this type of cryptography, is the high run time (with temporary magnitude scales around a second) required for data encryption or for processing or verifying digital signatures.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Although cannot speak about a security model, .NET Micro Framework provides the necessary tools to create a complete security model.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In the case of public communications networks, specific legal, regulatory and technical provisions should be made in order to protect fundamental rights and freedoms of natural person.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Measures should be taken to prevent unauthorized access to communications in order to protect the confidentiality of communications, including both the contents and any data related to such communications, by means of public communications networks and public available electronic services.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In digital mobile networks, location data giving the geographic position of the terminal equipment of the mobile user are processed to enable the transmission of communications.",,,,,1,,,,,
"On 25 June 2008, the European Parliament's Standing Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs asked for measures to correct the European Commission's proposal to amend the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (called ePrivacy Directive).",,,,,1,,,,,
The EDPS basically supported the EC proposal giving a few recommendations such as the obligation to notify any breach of security not only from providers of public electronic communication services in public networks but also from providers of information society services which process sensitive personal data.,,,,,1,,,,,
"When the number of nodes in the WSN grows and new services more complex are implemented, it is necessary to include authentication and authorization services in order to verify the data source and to allow taking authorization decisions.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In a model of communication between two parties, the data authentication can use symmetric mechanisms.",,,,,1,,,,,
Sender and receiver share a secret key to generate and verify a MAC (Message Authentication Code) [72].,,,,,1,,,,,
MAC mechanisms can be integrated into a sensor network through the protocol family SPINS (Security Protocols in Networked Systems ) [84].,,,,,1,,,,,
"The uTesla protocol solves this problem by introducing asymmetry through the delayed revelation of symmetric keys, allowing an efficient authentication broadcast scheme.",,,,,1,,,,,
However [85] explains that uTelsa is not suitable for the authentication traffic between nodes because it provides authentication delayed in time.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Therefore, authors as [86], propose the replacement of the initial distribution unicast using broadcast-based techniques.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The authors of [87] propose the use of a certificate called TESLA, which can be use by low capacity devices (such as WSN nodes) to provide entity authentication.",,,,,1,,,,,
A certificate of a legitimate user (U) is signed by the CA.,,,,,1,,,,,
However it may cause a bottleneck process from the sensor nodes if there is excessive traffic on the network.,,,,,0,,,,,
"What is new in this mechanism is to provide a key distribution combinatorial and deterministic, providing authentication is implemented as a security component of TinyOS.",,,,,1,,,,,
This mechanism based on multiple MAC messages and requires that network nodes have a key ring.,,,,,1,,,,,
"To authenticate a message, the source node generate a list of MAC based on their keys, and added them to the message.",,,,,1,,,,,
To meet the WSN restrictions must be designing an appropriate key ring.,,,,,1,,,,,
Task 2.4 aims at providing savvy users the means to assemble and program hardware that can be used by end-users to customize their smart environment.,,,,,1,,,,,
This section will provide a brief survey on the existing Do-it-Yourself hardware platforms and identify the technical challenges that need to be addressed to simplify the exposure of DiY devices in the DiYSE platform.,,,,,1,,,,,
It features a number of analog inputs and outputs to which different kinds of low cost sensors and actuators can easily be plugged.,,,,,1,,,,,
"It can easily be programmed using Wiring, a simple programming language, and the associated Arduino IDE.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Arduino features add-on modules called “shields”, which allow to add preassembled circuits to the main board to control motors, add Ethernet, Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The drawback is that in order to operate the device, the computer needs to be running.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Networked device: Arduino boards can participate in a network, either using Ethernet or ZigBee shields with the corresponding libraries.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In this set up, different Arduino-based devices can talk to each other, to computers in the LAN or even to servers on the Internet (a gateway is still required for ZigBee to IP bridging).",,,,,1,,,,,
This is the most interesting configuration for DiYSE as it enables interaction between the application creation environment and the devices.,,,,,1,,,,,
A huge number of embedded devices today run *NIX-like operating systems such as GNU/Linux and are open or hacked so that they can run custom software.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Indeed, peripherals such as Phidgets can be attached thus turning them into IP ambient devices that can be placed in buildings, vehicles or outdoor, powered by AC, batteries or even solar panels.",,,,,1,,,,,
This section will focus on how to easily connect self-programmed or self-assembled devices to a common infrastructure so that they can be accessed from the DiYSE application creation environment.,,,,,1,,,,,
Non-networked devices or devices that communicate with each other without interacting with computers or IP networks at all (e.g. a WiiMote controlling an Arduino-based Bluetooth lamp) are out of the scope of the DiYSE project because of the lack of obvious means to link them to the DiYSE application creation environment.,,,,,1,,,,,
"In general, IP devices host servers exposing their built-in functions, either through TCP or UDP servers, HTTP servers (possibly using a RESTful resource model [11]), UPnP [12] or DPWS [13].",,,,,1,,,,,
"In that case, user-added functions should also be exposed as services in the network.",,,,,0,,,,,
"As IP devices, they can directly participate in network interactions without intermediaries, either on the local network or through the Internet.",,,,,1,,,,,
UPnP and DPWS protocol stacks fully match the needs of plug-and-play IP devices and open-source tools enable the development of the service software for many embedded platforms.,,,,,1,,,,,
"However, the required effort make it more suited for industrial companies than for hobbyists.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Using an HTTP server (preferably using a RESTful resource model) is a good compromise, as HTTP servers are available in binary format for all kinds of IP devices and programming can be simply done through server-side scripts.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Description: in addition to discovery, the protocol enabling to control the device should be described or the software component enabling its usage (driver) made available in order to avoid users manually describing the interaction protocol.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Eventing: if devices are meant to receive commands and notify events, a callback mechanism should be implemented.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Assuming that the semantics and coordination of the device interaction is ensured by the upper layers, the remaining challenge for a Do-it-Yourself usage of this category of devices is the seamless search and deployment of the appropriate device drivers.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In order to achieve a sense of interaction without computers, these peripherals can be connected to the one of the abovementioned embedded GNU/Linux-based computers, which can run permanently, silently and hidden.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In this case, a network service exposing the peripheral to remote user applications would be required.",,,,,0,,,,,
This category groups devices that communicate using networks that do not use full TCP/IP stacks.,,,,,1,,,,,
"As an example, an increasing number of hobbyists that want wireless battery-powered devices buy ready-to-use ZigBee modules [14].",,,,,1,,,,,
These modules are easy to use as they behave like simple modems (communication uses serial and configuration is done through Hayes AT commands).,,,,,1,,,,,
"Having a computer (“gateway”) run a program that controls the whole network, hides its underlying complexity and exposes it as a service or “virtual device”.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The advantage is the solution is simple to implement, as it is equivalent to exposing a peripheral.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In this case, the role of the gateway is solely to compress and uncompress the IPv6 headers.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The remaining issue is that running a TCP stack on such low-power devices, even if feasible, is over-engineering for its actual usage.",,,,,1,,,,,
"This document, the EIRENE Functional Requirements Specification version 7.1, is an interim version released to address some known issues and errors in the specification and to ensure consistency with the EIRENE System Requirements Specification.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In case of any inconsistencies relating to EDOR, the EIRENE Functional Requirements Specification version 7.1 takes precedence over the EIRENE System Requirements Specification.",,,,,1,,,,,

The full number used within the functional addressing scheme to identify an end user/system by function or role rather than by a specific item of radio equipment or user subscription.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Only one member of the group may talk at any instant, with all other group members listening only.",,,,,1,,,,,
"High priority calls (critical group calls for drivers in the same area initiated by a driver, critical group calls for station and security staff, trackside maintenance staff or controller groups) are made in exceptional circumstances where the situation requires a higher level of priority than for normal operational calls, but the same call handling regarding alerting and setup.",,,,,1,,,,,
A form of unidirectional signalling transmitted periodically or constantly from one radio to another to allow the receiving user to detect a break in radio transmission during critical manoeuvres (eg during shunting).,,,,,1,,,,,
An open interface is an interface complying with published standards.,,,,,1,,,,,
"A call of highest priority for informing drivers, controllers and other concerned personnel of a level of danger requiring all Railways movements in a pre-defined area to stop.",,,,,1,,,,,
Secondary Controllers require the facility to communicate with trains in all situations in order to perform their function.,,,,,1,,,,,
A radio is considered in “Shunting Mode” when it is prepared to receive shunting emergency calls but cannot receive train emergency calls.,,,,,1,,,,,
A group of people manoeuvring trains in order to change their location or composition.,,,,,0,,,,,
Communications for shunting are particularly critical when a driver at the front of a train is pushing it backwards towards buffers or other potential obstructions.,,,,,1,,,,,
In this case a lookout is often required to report progress to the driver.,,,,,0,,,,,
A radio is considered in “Train Mode” when it is prepared to receive train emergency calls but cannot receive shunting emergency calls.,,,,,1,,,,,
A train number may form a component of a functional number used to address users/systems on a train.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The EIRENE Functional Requirements Specification defines a set of requirements which a railway radio system should comply with, in order to facilitate international interoperability between national railways and manufacturing economies of scale.",,,,,1,,,,,
"This specification therefore defines the functional requirements, to ensure that core railway functionality is provided.",,,,,0,,,,,
It is mandatory that each railway meets these specifications on lines where interoperability is required.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Optional requirements are not mandatory for interoperability and, as such, the selection (or non-selection) of a set of optional requirements on a national basis shall not be used as a precondition for the certification and the acceptance of roaming mobile equipment on GSM-R networks.",,,,,1,,,,,

It shall be possible for the driver to initiate a call to any of the following types of controller with a minimum of driver action being required (eg a single keystroke): (M) - power supply controller.,,,,,1,,,,,
"If the radio system cannot give a unique identity for a given type of controller, the identity could be obtained using external systems as defined in 11.4.7.",,,,,1,,,,,
"If the system is not able to connect the call, an audible and visual indication shall be provided to the driver that the call was not received by the controller.",,,,,1,,,,,
This shall also indicate if the called party was busy or if the network could not connect the call.,,,,,0,,,,,
"In the latter case, the controller is automatically added into the multi- driver call.",,,,,0,,,,,

The Operational radio should have a carry feature that allows the operator to instantly have both hands free without dropping the radio.,,,,,1,,,,,
It shall be possible to change the battery without losing data stored in the radio.,,,,,1,,,,,
"This common terminal platform should have interfaces, applications and accessories to fulfil specific national railway needs.",,,,,1,,,,,
"For activation, a maximum of 2 MMI actions should be allowed.",,,,,1,,,,,
"At the detailed level, different controllers may have specific addressing needs, eg catering controllers will need to call specific vehicles in a train.",,,,,1,,,,,
International standardisation of numbering plans is needed to ensure interworking between networks.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Furthermore, standardised allocation of numbers to subscribers will facilitate schemes for identification, barring, etc.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Telephone numbers can be defined on a national basis, but codes for certain functions shall be used on an international basis in order to allow interoperability.",,,,,1,,,,,
"For certain functions, standardised telephone numbers shall be implemented.",,,,,1,,,,,
"To provide interoperability between the fixed railway networks within the EIRENE network, standardisation of UIC group numbering will be required.",,,,,1,,,,,

This facility is required principally for the safe conduct of pushing manoeuvres to assure continuing availability of the radio channel while a shunting worker is guiding a train driver.,,,,,1,,,,,
"This document also represents a guide for the developing process, because it informs about the priority of the tasks, the dependencies among the tasks and the information they require, including the background, objectives, and targets too.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In the process of the requirements definition, we can use different approaches depending on the software methodology.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In this case, we chose the Durán and Bernárdez (2002) methodology because it offers a simple, but powerful, process to elicit and document the requirements.",,,,,0,,,,,
"This methodology is based on tables, where we fill the information about a specific requirement.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In our methodology, the authors defined three types of requirements.",,,,,1,,,,,
There is very important to set these requirements in order to develop the system that is going to manage the data.,,,,,1,,,,,
"In WYRED one of the most important thing is to maximize the users’ privacy, due to this we are going to split the user’s information between public and private in the platform.",,,,,1,,,,,
This information was selected with ours partners to keep the minimum information required to develop a correct social dialogue.,,,,,1,,,,,
The platform also has to manage more information about its users due to this can help us to extract patterns and get conclusions.,,,,,1,,,,,
"However, this information will be private and nobody will see the private information of a specific user.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Therefore, it will be treated anonymously in order to respect the users’ privacy.",,,,,0,,,,,
"For this reason, we decided keeping them in a dedicate server to improve the platform performance.",,,,,0,,,,,
"When we planned how to design a platform for youth people, we checked that they use more their mobiles than other classic devices such as laptops or desktops.",,,,,1,,,,,
"For this reason, we decided to use a responsive design that can work well in all kinds of devices.",,,,,0,,,,,
"However, creating a platform where our users are going to use mainly mobiles has other problem, the performance.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Usually mobiles have wireless connections and depending on the country, they can be a bit slow, so we add a requirement about the platform performance.",,,,,1,,,,,
"We also would like to develop a mobile application for the more common mobile systems (Android and iOS), in order to get a better response from the user.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Due to this, we have planned to use Linux servers and free technologies.",,,,,0,,,,,
"One of the most important objectives is to keep all content in the platform hidden for public users, because we are working, in some cases, with underage people.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Moreover, we will put an option where the users can inform a moderator that there is a message that should be analyze.",,,,,1,,,,,
"For this reason, we have to allow that a user can register in WYRED.",,,,,0,,,,,
"However, WYRED is not a chat but a platform where there should exist a structured social dialogue, so we are going to develop something like forum topics.",,,,,1,,,,,
"With the objective of having a good response, first of all, the users will fill a form where they can say in which things they are interested in.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Therefore, a researcher or a user will create a project, this will be hidden for all that are not invited to participate; for achieving this, the creator will select what kind of users are going to be invited using the public user’s information.",,,,,0,,,,,
"This helps to improve a lot of metrics such as page views, used time and social sharing.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The first requirement, which we have defined with this aim, was a translation system due to there are users from countries that speak different languages.",,,,,1,,,,,
"We have also thought that it would be interesting to use a gamification system to increase the users’ engagement, due to it is one of the most common technique used right now.",,,,,1,,,,,
"For improving the usability, we have planned to design custom styles for each age group, because of teenagers do not want to use a childish platform.",,,,,1,,,,,
"We have also kept in mind that if a user likes our platform, she would like to share it with her friends, for this reason, we will develop an easy tool for social sharing.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In the social dialogue process, the researchers need to work with many kind of documents, such as text, audio, images and video.",,,,,1,,,,,
"These documents are a relevant part in the WYRED project, so we have planned to develop tools for showing and sharing them.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The researchers are also an important part of the WYRED project, for this reason, they are going to have a private zone.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In this zone, they will be able to monitor their own social dialogues, share information between the project researchers and analyze their data.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In order to improve the data analysis process, we are going to develop visualization tools and a pattern matching system.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The visualization tools will help the researchers to discover knowledge using charts, trees and other representations.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The pattern matching system will use techniques such as datamining or natural language processing, in order to give to the researchers some patterns about the stored data.",,,,,1,,,,,
"If we can, it would be good has a system to personalize the avatar.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The system shall have a multi-platform native approach, for this reason we should create an application for the most important mobile operating system (Android and iOS).",,,,,1,,,,,
"The system shall keep all content hidden for public users, browsers, etc.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The system shall have moderation tools to allow moderators edit, move and delete messages.",,,,,1,,,,,

"In 2011, after a meeting of the Space Science Advisory Committee, the M3 candidate missions for the Cosmic-Vision 2015-2025 programme were selected for further assessment and consideration for launch in the early 2020’s.",,,,,1,,,,,
During the fall 2011 the mission concept was studied in the Concurrent Design Facility at ESTEC (internal pre-assessment) in order to prepare a thorough industrial assessment phase.,,,,,1,,,,,
The purpose of the ongoing assessment phase is to assess the feasibility of this mission.,,,,,1,,,,,
"After the assessment phase ending in 2013, one M-class mission will be selected.",,,,,1,,,,,
"If adopted, the mission would proceed into definition and implementation (Phases B1/B2/C/D).",,,,,1,,,,,
"In parallel with the system level activities, an Announcement of Opportunity will be issued calling for the provision of scientific instruments by the science community through ESA.",,,,,1,,,,,

"Later on in the course of the definition phase, it will result into two self-standing documents, i.e. the Mission Requirements Document and the System Requirements Document.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The traceability of the requirements is paramount in order to make this document and its associated requirements easy to read and to understand at any stage of the mission assessment and possibly later definition phase, should this mission be selected.",,,,,1,,,,,
It will be reviewed as part of the assessment phase and will be updated following the Preliminary Requirement Review at the end of 2013.,,,,,1,,,,,

Goals may be fulfilled under limited favourable conditions.,,,,,1,,,,,
They are highlighted in italic in order to be easily identified.,,,,,1,,,,,
This is intended only to assist the understanding of the requirement or its origin (the Parent requirement ID might be sometimes included wherever applicable).,,,,,0,,,,,
"Should a requirement be deleted in a later update of this document, its number will not be reused and should a requirement be introduced in between other requirements, the last digit will be used (e.g. R-YYY-115 between R-YYY-110 and R-YYY-120).",,,,,1,,,,,
"After one successful sampling rehearsal, the spacecraft, which will be designed to cope with surface hazards (e.g. large clearance to the surface), navigates towards the finally selected touchdown/sampling site and collects hundreds of g of surface material.",,,,,,1,,,,
Therefore the spacecraft performs a soft touchdown of the surface for a few seconds (in the order of 2-5 seconds) and then takes-off immediately after that to move into a safe position away from the surface.,,,,,,1,,,,
"If it is confirmed, via a reliable verification technique, that a scientifically meaningful sample has been collected, the sample is transferred to the re-entry capsule and sealed.",,,,,,1,,,,
The spacecraft is then ready for departure back to Earth or can carry on orbital science if desired.,,,,,,0,,,,
"If the sampling operation was not successful, the spacecraft can undertake 2 more attempts (3 attempts in total).",,,,,,1,,,,
The spacecraft departs from the asteroid in August 2026 and returns to Earth in April 2029 after one Venus swing-by in November 2027.,,,,,,1,,,,
The re-entry capsule is then released and undertakes a high-speed Earth re-entry at Ventry of maximum ~ 13 km.s-1 (in other scenarios the re-entry velocity is lower ~ 11-12.6 km.s-1).,,,,,,0,,,,
All other instruments are in off (if allowed by their thermal requirements) or stand-by mode.,,,,,,1,,,,

"The ERC should be equipped with a flight instrumentation package to perform the following measurements during entry and descent: heat flux, temperature and pressure on both front and back shields at a frequency of 0.5 Hz (TBC).",,,,,,1,,,,
"If implemented, the maximum allowable shocks on the memory shall be defined and included in R-SYS-300.",,,,,,0,,,,
The spacecraft design and operations shall transmit back to Earth a minimum total payload data volume of 122.35 GBit (TBC) before the end of the asteroid proximity operations.,,,,,,1,,,,
Specific attention to be given to asteroid IR flux and closest distance to the Sun during transfer.,,,,,,1,,,,

"The combination of the sampling spacecraft and the Earth re-entry capsule, stacked together from launch through asteroid surface and proximity operations and cruises phases up until the release of the ERC.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Radio-science orbit: In the context of MarcoPolo-R, a Radio-science orbit is an asteroid-bound orbit, favourable to radio science measurements, where the S/C does not require any orbit and attitude manoeuvres in order to remain above 3 km distance to the surface at any time, during four consecutive communication windows of 8 hours.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Safe position: In the context of MarcoPolo-R, a safe position is an eclipse-free location where the spacecraft does not require any orbit and attitude manoeuvres during at least one week in order to remain at least 1 km distance away from the surface of the asteroid surface (and its secondary if applicable).",,,,,,1,,,,
"Similarly, reliable measurements of Fe lines can only be made when both the Fe spectral edges around 8-9 keV and the continuum at energies significantly higher than these edge energies can be well measured.",,,,,,1,,,,
"To these aims study of Quasi-Periodic-Oscillations (QPOs) in the time domain, Fe line reverberation and tomography in bright Active Galactic Nucleus (AGNs) and Galactic Black Hole Candidates (BHCs) will be exploited.",,,,,,0,,,,
The minimum scientific success criteria for the mission are reached if the two core science objectives (TOP1 and TOP2) are achieved.,,,,,,1,,,,
Probe the interior structure of isolated neutron stars by observing seismic oscillations in Soft Gamma-ray Repeater intermediate flares when they occur with flux ~1000 Crab through high energy photons (> 20 keV).,,,,,,1,,,,
Detect disk precession due to relativistic frame dragging with the Fe line variations in low frequency QPOs for 10 neutron stars and 5 black holes.,,,,,,1,,,,
"If a change in state of a source for the core program is observed, LOFT may be pointed to this source and repeated observations are feasible till the source state is no longer of interest.",,,,,,1,,,,
For the core science objectives processing of these data on the basis of a few days is sufficient to adjust the observation schedule if a source state changes.,,,,,,1,,,,
The LOFT WFM should allow for the detection of these bursts with sufficient spectral resolution to investigate if the neutron star compactness can be constrained.,,,,,,1,,,,
"It should be d that not all events can be reconstructed with the same resolution, depending on the number of anodes to reconstruct the energy.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The loss of a whole panel and subsequent reduction in effective area may compromise some capability (e.g. EOS2), however many science goals could be completed albeit with longer observation times.",,,,,,1,,,,
In addition the 25% redundancy requirement may need to be adjusted in order to maintain a 7.5 m2 effective area in case of a single point failure.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: 2 keV: to be able to study photoelectric absorption and soft components of a variety of sources, 30 keV: to determine the AGN and X-ray binary continuum spectra in order to study the reflection/absorption effects and allow for an accurate determination of the Fe-K line profile.,,,,,,1,,,
"After applying all known calibration factors, the linearity and offset of the energy scale applying to a measured spectrum shall allow a photon energy to be determined to within a small fraction.",,,,,,1,,,,
Selected events are only those that correspond to the read-out of a single anode (explaining the 40% of the selected events).,,,,,,0,,,,
"However this is related to the response stability, it can only be considered if the response stability goals are within reach.",,,,,,1,,,,
"As the latter highly depends on the type of source/signal and its characteristic frequencies, it is hard to specify the requirement with a single number.",,,,,,0,,,,
Unstable response leads to apparent noise in constant flux sources and also to QPO broadening or sidebands.,,,,,,1,,,,
Intrinsic to the detector is that the arrival time of an event is not known much better than 10(7) µsec as the drift time through the detector depends on the position of the event with respect to the anode.,,,,,,1,,,,
"For pulsars, knowing the detection time with an accuracy of 2 microsecond allows comparison with other wavebands (e.g. radio).",,,,,,1,,,,
"That is, if you can measure the Fourier transform to a certain precision given the count rate, then the uncertainty in the distortions induced by dead time to the Fourier transform should be less than that precision.",,,,,,1,,,,
Bright transient sources can be stored on-board and the full information can be transferred during subsequent ground contacts.,,,,,,1,,,,
This does not drive the design in view of the spectral slope and the stopping power of the collimator for photons < 20 keV where the bulk of the photons are for these 1000 Crab sources.,,,,,,0,,,,
Sensitivity (5 σ detection) over 50 ks must be < 5 mCrab over energy range of 2 - 50 keV for a field where there is no source confusion (outside the Galactic Centre).,,,,,,1,,,,
"If the LAD data rate is <80%, the WFM should be able to use up the available bandwidth.",,,,,,1,,,,
Energy range and telemetry bandwidth should allow at least 8 spectral bands for the detection of spectral state changes in transient sources and be sensitive to thermal (e.g. disk) spectral components.,,,,,,1,,,,
The angular resolution and source localization accuracy are related and the source localization depends also in the signal to noise ratio.,,,,,,1,,,,
The localization depends on the angular resolution and the signal to noise ratio.,,,,,,1,,,,
"After applying all calibration knowledge, the relative change in flux sensitivity with off-axis angle must be known to a small fraction and within radii corresponding with an area at least 20% of peak on-axis area.",,,,,,1,,,,
"After applying all ground based calibration knowledge, the accuracy of determining the flux of any given target, and the also minimum flux sensitivity, from one pointing period to another.",,,,,,1,,,,
This allows scientific products from WFM such as edges from type I bursts.,,,,,,0,,,,
Justification: Allows the downlink of limited data in a number of energy bands that match interesting regions in the energy spectrum.,,,,,,0,,,,
The transients may be detected both in triggered data and in normal data if the transient rise time is >100s or a spectral state change has occurred.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Justification: Factor 2 faster, it is not expected that this will drive the design and is acceptable if this is not reached for 100% of the cases.",,,,,,1,,,,
Justification Onboard memory will store up to 3 hours of data (although depending on the event rate some binning is foreseen for bright events/episodes/areas).,,,,,,1,,,,
"After a trigger into burst mode, the WFM will attempt to localise the source on the sky and determine the time of trigger.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Justification: If broadcasted, a set of ground receivers can see the trigger times and positions for follow up measurements.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Justification Estimates suggest there should be at least 150 GRB per year detected by WFM, therefore statistically several per day should be accommodated.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Justification: Other triggers such as Type 1 X-ray bursts, as well as potential false triggers imply the need for relatively frequent downloading of burst triggers.",,,,,,1,,,,
The design and geometric arrangement of the WFM shall be such that in the case of a single point failure still the full FoV should be covered although it is accepted that the effective area as well as the angular resolution for a certain part of the sky is reduced.,,,,,,1,,,,
This allows for transmission of these data to the ground after the transient event happened without loss of information.,,,,,,1,,,,
The WFM is less than 10% of the total bandwidth unless a Guest Observer requests this to be higher.,,,,,,1,,,,
"There is no theoretical limit on the shortest observation time and hence, during night time there will be additional observing time if the satellite slews to a given position.",,,,,,1,,,,
Otherwise (50% sky visibility) the observation time when the bulge is visible to LOFT is used for a significant fraction by observing the core-science targets.,,,,,,1,,,,
"This shall be a 3σ radius value, and applies once the LAD boresight to star tracker offset is calibrated in orbit.",1,,,,,,,,,
Justification: This is well within the field of view of the LAD.,1,,,,,,,,,
Justification: Any pointing jitter can be corrected on the ground if we have good knowledge about the pointing.,1,,,,,,,,,
"This provides additional margin, especially in the case of finite frequencies that exceed the SCI-LAD-G-26 specification.",1,,,,,,,,,
Justification: As many star trackers provide few arcseconds pointing knowledge it would be nice to have this but it is not really required.,1,,,,,,,,,
Justification: Only a LEO orbit provides a low enough background.,1,,,,,,,,,
In combination with a low inclination the radiation damage to the detectors will be low enough to have them passively cooled and still reach the end-of-life temperature requirements.,1,,,,,,,,,
Justification: A lower inclination will reduce the effects of the SAA.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Justification: This allows for slewing of the satellite during monitoring campaigns and is directly related to SCI-SYS-R-04, this is NOT equal to the average number of slews per orbit which depend on the observation plan (see RD4).",1,,,,,,,,,
Justification: This increases the number of potential observations of otherwise inaccessible targets (at a given time) by a factor 2.,1,,,,,,,,,
Although not the prime science it is clear that fast response times will enable additional science.,1,,,,,,,,,
Justification: LOFT is not a mission dedicated to fast transients (like SWIFT).,1,,,,,,,,,
Therefore the ToO response time should not drive the design of the ground system.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Clearly, this requirement should not inhibit faster response times in case a ToO is identified at the beginning of a working day.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Following the change of a source state, the relevant sources will be on between something like a week to very long periods (campaigns up to one year after the transient trigger may be expected).",1,,,,,,,,,
This makes a response of < 12 hours for the core science not mandatory.,1,,,,,,,,,
Clearly a faster response will improve the science in general (see the goal).,1,,,,,,,,,
"A Quick Look data analysis subsystem should be provided at SOC (and SDC) in order to determine the properties of triggering sources and LAD target object in order to provide an alert for observation plan changes, and verify LOFT Burst Alert messages.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The analysis using a QLA system should be powerful enough to be able to identify source spectral and brightness changes that allow an alert for new ToOs to be generated, or identify failure to meet observing proposal criteria.",1,,,,,,,,,
The planning cycle to update the observing plan shall be <7days and therefore QLA should be able to generate the required data for Duty Scientist decision on a much shorter timescale.,1,,,,,,,,,
The re-planning timescales should be faster to avoid loss of useful observing time.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The science data rate generated by the instruments, after nominal binning and lossless compression ratios, when observing a source at the typical LAD brightness for event mode data.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Justification: For a 150 mCrab source, observed with an efficiency of 60% the data rates must support the full LAD event mode data.",1,,,,,,,,,
Justification: Increase in the data rate for the WFM to exploit fully the available transmission rate.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The science data rate generated by the instruments, after nominal binning and lossless compression ratios, when observing a source at the maximum LAD brightness for event mode data.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Justification: For a 500 mCrab source, observed with an efficiency of 60% the data rates must support all LAD event mode data.",1,,,,,,,,,
Justification: Increase of the LAD source to >1 Crab without loss of information.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Justification: This is linked to the previous science requirement SCI-SYS-R16 (500 mCrab) , and SCI-LAD-R19 and the minimal telemetry of the WFM, under the assumption of no loss of LAD information within the above limits.",1,,,,,,,,,
Justification: Enables the higher sustained rate required by the goal SCI-SYS-R-16 in the previous requirement.,1,,,,,,,,,
"This number of observed sources is larger than the number of required sources as it is not always known a priori if a source is in a given state, We also specify whether the spectral resolution is important for the science goal (Fe-line characterization).",1,,,,,,,,,
"For the Neutron Stars, both transient outburst NS and the transient weak NS will be observed.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Most classes of sources serve to address >1 science goal as is already indicated in Table produced based on this table, and for the purposes of deriving the impact of the observing plan on the system, has been made applicable to the mission in the MRD.",1,,,,,,,,,
"When the source state changes, a change in the observing program can be triggered but then, for this source, a campaign of weeks to longer periods is started.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Only when, during this campaign, the source fades away, the campaign can be stopped to save observing time.",1,,,,,,,,,
"So, effectively we expect about 60 ToOs over the mission life time.",1,,,,,,,,,
"If the total number of pointings is a concern, pointings of less than 10 ks can be added up to make pointings of at least 10 ksec in length.",1,,,,,,,,,
For some ~10 of AGN2 sources additional offset background fields are needed (~700ks total).,1,,,,,,,,,
There should be several “standard” background fields that must be quasi-periodically revisited to monitor the evolution of background.,1,,,,,,,,,
Observing times and schedules in the overwhelming majority of cases are set by intrinsic source state variations rather than by S/N considerations.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Sources have different spectral/timing states, and we need to sample each state over a range of luminosities in order to understand the processes we are detecting with LOFT, or in order to catch a source in the right state to see the process in the first place.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The total observing time required for the top level science requirement is 24.7 Ms, which corresponds with a realistic but conservative observing efficiency of 50% to 1.6 years elapsed time of which ToO targets are to cover several flux levels in each source).",1,,,,,,,,,
"However, it should be recognized that we need a longer mission duration to ensure a good probability to observe the rare transient events needed for some of the science goals.",1,,,,,,,,,
"There are no SGRs in the table as we only have the serendipitous offset observations as a top level goal – we DO plan to have TOO triggers in place for when an SGR becomes active, to point at them to see if intermediate flares happen – this is not guaranteed to succeed, hence not a top level goal.",1,,,,,,,,,
We have selected realistic assumptions in the sense that we do not take into account that the number can be larger due to the huge improvement in the sensitivity of LOFT compared to RXTE.,1,,,,,,,,,
This probability has to be folded with the field of regard of the mission (as it is of no use if LOFT cannot observe the source when it becomes active due to viewing constraints.,1,,,,,,,,,
Based on these expectations it is concluded that the minimum life time of the mission should be 4 years for a sky visibility of +30/-50 degree and 3 years for +30/-70 degree.,1,,,,,,,,,
Under these conditions the expectation for 3 BH transient outbursts and AMXPs is around 95% and the probability of detecting two in each group is larger than 99%.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Also, with a conservative estimate of 50% observing efficiency the full program can be performed.",1,,,,,,,,,
"It will, of course, affect the overall science return of the mission as it reduces the discovery space.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Hence the nominal Field of Regard with nominal spectral resolution is driven by those core science objectives which need good spectral resolution (SFG2, SFG4, SFG5) and for the other science goals the extended field of regard can be used.",1,,,,,,,,,
"If good spectral resolution is available also for the observations aimed at the other core science objectives, it will enable a desirable a larger field of regard or extended field of regard allow for a shorter mission duration provided we can execute the observations for the core science (e.g. sky visibility of the Galactic Centre is sufficient).",1,,,,,,,,,
"As is indicated some of the L1 core requirements can be fully compensated but in other cases some loss of science (less sensitivity, fewer sources) can also be the consequence.",1,,,,,,,,,
In summary this analysis shows that the core science goals are not at stake if the effective area reduces by the order of 10%.,1,,,,,,,,,
When larger reductions in the effective area are needed it is strongly recommended to optimize some of these other design parameters.,1,,,,,,,,,
The Nominal Field of Regard is the part of the sky which can be observed with the nominal energy resolution and the extended field of regard has been introduced to allow for observations of sources where the energy resolution is not required.,1,,,,,,,,,
"As can be seen there is a considerable margin between the needed observing time with good spectral resolution and the available observing time (needed 8.1, available 17.8 for a 4 year mission).",1,,,,,,,,,
Also with a shorter mission the margin is significant.,1,,,,,,,,,
This potential risk is mitigated by the allowance of regular out of field of regard observations (due to the few hour thermal intertia of the system).,1,,,,,,,,,
"As can be seen from Table A-2 the visibility with a very small solar constraint (± 10o) gives still a total of 8.7 Ms for a 4 year mission, well in excess over the needed observing time.",1,,,,,,,,,
It is very important to have the broadband energy coverage to model the reflection properties measuring both Fe line profile and Compton reflection continuum above 10 keV.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The good leverage on the continuum in a broad energy band will allow us to disentangle all spectral components and, in turn, to correctly model the residuals of the Fe line.",1,,,,,,,,,
"In this respect the high energy response of LOFT is unique, covering simultaneously the 2-30 keV band with a great improvement in effective area in both low and high energy ranges, a factor >60 higher with respect to XMM in the Fe K domain and a factor of ~30 with respect to NuStar or Astro-H at 30 keV.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The 2 keV low end of the bandwidth has been set to enable the study of photo electric absorption and soft components, the 30 keV allows one to determine the AGN and X-ray binary continuum spectra in order to study reflection or absorption effects and allow for the accurate determination of the continuum underneath the Fe-K line profile.",1,,,,,,,,,
With an upper range of 80 keV (no specific resolution is required) fast high-energy phenomena such as SGR/AXP flares can be studied.,1,,,,,,,,,
In practice these bandwidth limits are not absolute limits but the science will degrade gradually (an effect of about 10% in the energy thresholds has a small effect on the science but it depends somewhat on details of the science case).,1,,,,,,,,,
"It should be d that the energy range is unique for the WFM and will, for the first time enable the monitoring of the sky below 5 keV with CCD-class spectral resolution.",1,,,,,,,,,
The energy resolution of the LAD is driven by three of the five goals (level 1) of the Strong Field Gravity science and these have been used to define the energy resolution requirement.,1,,,,,,,,,
"However, whereas these science goals drive the energy resolution, the combination of spectral resolution with timing resolution (large effective area) will open up a new discovery space and the results of this new discovery space cannot be predicted at this time.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Hence, we have aimed at a design with an ambitious but feasible , but ambitious energy resolution.",1,,,,,,,,,
"As we will show, with CCD-class spectral resolution and passively cooled detectors we can achieve these three science goals.",1,,,,,,,,,
"They will have different resolution but for simplicity we will analyze the data for the full detector and refer to this as ~ 240 eV resolution (“nominal” energy resolution) and study the science impact in the event of a degradation, taking 270 eV and 300 eV as case study (it is useful to here that this is not the degradation in energy resolution associated with the extended field of regard, which is 400 eV).",1,,,,,,,,,
The two main components to the resolution are the intrinsic limiting resolution of Silicon detectors (called Fano noise) and the electronic noise (read-out pre-amplifier and detector leakage current).,1,,,,,,,,,
"A number of other components - including uncertainties in the knowledge of DC noise, gain and offset (see LOFT-IAPS-PLC-MD-0001 for details) - contribute to the resolution but they are of less importance.",1,,,,,,,,,
A degraded spectral resolution will increase the uncertainty on the determination of the centroid (typically by the inverse of the degraded resolution) for a given model.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The extra uncertainty here is statistical (depending also on photons per phase or time-delay bin), rather than systematic (i.e. not being able to distinguish distinct variable spectral components, which are all broad in this case and variable in much longer time scale with respect to the orbital period of the disc).",1,,,,,,,,,
"Thus the increase of the uncertainty can be mitigated by longer observations, with the exposure time scaling roughly with the square of the relative degradation in energy.",1,,,,,,,,,
This has been verified by detailed simulations for an orbiting hot spot and for the reverberation mapping.,1,,,,,,,,,
The fact that the Fe-line is relatively broad and we also fit the broad reflection component confirms this also qualitatively.,1,,,,,,,,,
This argument is only correct if the hot spot lasts long enough to compensate a loss in spectral resolution by longer observations.,1,,,,,,,,,
"However, in case of a hot spot the prime science comes from the variability of the spectra.",1,,,,,,,,,
In this case the complexity and correctness of the model for the emission without hot spot is therefore of less importance.,1,,,,,,,,,
"We worked with AGN, since they will represent the weak, i.e. worst, case scenario.",1,,,,,,,,,
"A-2 where the 68, 90 and 99% (black, red and green respectively) confidence levels of the disc inclination vs BH’s spin are given We also mention that all narrow emission line components in the X-ray spectra of AGNs are produced in reprocessing media distant from ~0.1pc to a few pc from the central BH (BLR and molecular torus) and then likely constant over years timescales.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Since we are targeting here bright AGNs, Chandra and XMM already observed all of them allowing characterization of the narrow emission lines.",1,,,,,,,,,
It is also worth noting that Astro-H will observe the AGN LAD sample long enough to characterize with its unprecedented eV precision all narrow components in the Fe K energy range.,1,,,,,,,,,
With the nominal energy response of 240 eV we are able to disentangle all the different line components in the Fe region and get good measurements of the blurred reflection components (continuum and lines).,1,,,,,,,,,
"As an example, starting with BH spin a=0.7, we were able to recover the BH spin at the ~20% level of accuracy, despite the presence of narrow Fe Kα, Fe Kβ, Ni Kα and ionized lines due to a ""hot gas"" emitter with ionization parameter log(xi)~3.5 (see left panel in Fig.",1,,,,,,,,,
"In particular, the ionized lines (Fe XXV/XXVI with equivalent width ~ 40 eV) are blurred together and with the broad line blue wing that prevents the determination of the disc inclination and emissivity with the requested accuracy.",1,,,,,,,,,
This also prevents an accurate spin determination and the error rises to > 50 % (see right panel in Fig.,1,,,,,,,,,
"In this case the scientific objective is still reached, although with a larger uncertainties on the spin determination (typical 99% confidence level at ~40%, see middle panel in Fig.",1,,,,,,,,,
"It has been illustrated that even in the event of an energy resolution not meeting the requirement, consequences for the science objectives can be mitigated by longer observations, with the exception of the Fe-line profile fitting where a 10% spectral resolution degradation is still within the science requirements but a 20% degradation will not meet the requirements.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Of course, this conclusion depends on the assumption that we have a correct understanding and description of the spectra of these sources (and with a better energy resolution this will be verified more easily).",1,,,,,,,,,
The flow down from level 0 to level 1 is omitted for brevity.,1,,,,,,,,,
The actual value is set at 400 eV but could be also somewhat larger (100 eV) before affecting the science significantly.,1,,,,,,,,,
LAD-18 With the proper knowledge on the background (including variations over an orbit) a larger background is acceptable.,1,,,,,,,,,
WFM-08 Allows to combine data from different epochs.,1,,,,,,,,,
At the same time a few requirements have been dropped as they were obsolete or better captured in a more general formulation.,1,,,,,,,,,
The relevant requirements are given below for traceability.,1,,,,,,,,,
Concept of flat top was dropped and replaced by pointing stability Replaced by a more top level orbit with low background and low radiation Dropped in favor of the more generic requirement.,0,,,,,,,,,
Accordingly it was decided that the data rate and other technical issues should be captured in this appendix in order to trace the scientific arguments behind design issues that should instead be reflected in the Experiment Interface Document Annex A.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Within the M3 boundary conditions, the readiness for launch by 2022/2024 is a severe requirement which in practice requires designing the space segment without major technology developments and with minimum developments risks.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, only technologies with estimated Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of at least 5 by the end of the Phase A/B1 (estimated at the end of 2015) may be used.",1,,,,,,,,,
"This document aims at providing a complete and comprehensive list of all high level mission requirements (including S/C and payload, launcher, ground segment and operations) necessary to achieve the science goals detailed in [AD1].",1,,,,,,,,,
It is hence an applicable document that all mission design activities shall comply with.,1,,,,,,,,,
The MRD will be further reviewed matching the results of future study phases (e.g. definition phase) to finally evolve in the System Requirements Document at the start of the implementation phase.,1,,,,,,,,,
They shall be verified by the Contractor using a verification method approved by ESA.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Goals are desirable in order to maximise the science return while keeping the impact on the cost and complexity to a minimum, but not mandatory.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Requirements are identified by the use of the term “shall”, as opposed to “should” for goals.",1,,,,,,,,,
"X is the requirement type: “R” for a requirement or “G” for a goal YYYY is the requirement category consisting of 2, 3 to 4 letters nnn is the requirement identifier (sequential number of 3 digits).",1,,,,,,,,,
"Each requirement is applicable to either the S/C prime industrial contractor, the instrument consortium or the ground segment (or a combination of these 3).",1,,,,,,,,,
Requirements applicable to the S/C only are flown-down into the SRD.,1,,,,,,,,,
Requirements applicable to the S/C and the instrument are budgeted into the RJBD.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Requirements applicable to the ground segment will be flown-down into the Ground Segment Requirements Document, the MAD and the SOAD.",1,,,,,,,,,
Supplementary text added to explain the source or reasoning behind a requirement shall be written after the requirement in italics.,1,,,,,,,,,
"In addition to those, all ESA approved standards (including relevant ECSS standards) are applicable documents as well.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Using the differential technique of transit spectroscopy, EChO will obtain transmission and/or emission spectra of the atmospheres of a large and diverse sample of known exoplanets covering a wide range of characteristics.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The instantaneous spectral coverage of EChO is unique in its breadth, spanning the visible to thermal infrared through a series of contiguous spectrometer channels that provide continuous spectral coverage.",1,,,,,,,,,
This broad range opens up the possibility to study exoplanets with physical temperatures ranging from a few hundred to over a few thousand degrees Kelvin.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Importantly, broad instantaneous spectral coverage that includes the visible waveband provides an essential means by which to monitor and subsequently correct for the effects of activity of the host star, which could otherwise introduce significant uncertainty into the final exoplanet spectrum and its interpretation.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The transit spectroscopy method, whereby the signal from the star and planet are differentiated using knowledge of the planetary ephemerides, allows atmospheric signals from the planet at levels of at least 10-4 relative to the star to be measured.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Photometric stability rather than angular resolution is therefore key, and in fact the most stringent requirement of EChO, driving many engineering design and operational aspects of the mission.",1,,,,,,,,,
For the brightest targets it will be possible to obtain high quality spectra in a single visit, for fainter targets the necessary signal-to-noise will be built up through repeated visits over the mission lifetime.,1,,,,,,,,
EChO will allow scientists to study exoplanets both as a population and as individuals.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The spectroscopic information (at resolving powers of ≥300 below 5 um and ≥30 above) on the atmospheres of the large, select sample of exoplanets that EChO will provide will allow the compositions, temperature (profile), size and variability to be determined at a level never previously attempted.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The ground segment provides the means and resources necessary to manage and control the mission via telecommands, to receive and process the telemetry from the satellite, and to disseminate and archive the generated products.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The Mission Operation Centre (MOC) is responsible for the operations of the spacecraft and instruments, for ensuring the spacecraft safety and health, for provision of flight dynamics support including determination and control of the satellite’s orbit and attitude and for provision of data (science and S/C housekeeping) to the Science Operation Centre (SOC).",1,,,,,,,,,
"The scope of the Science Operation Centre (SOC) varies from one mission to another, depending on the scientific organisation of the mission, the responsibilities for each instrument and the partnerships to be put in place.",1,,,,,,,,,
"In-orbit around the Sun-Earth L2 point for optimum thermo-mechanical stability, the EChO S/C will point at known transiting exoplanets distributed over the sky, with an expected bias towards targets closer to the ecliptic poles.",1,,,,,,,,,
"This will enable an uninterrupted observation of the transits of these targets over longer periods of times within each year, as well as reducing the noise generated by the zodiacal background.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The telescope feeds a single science instrument, covering the complete wave range using dichroic mirrors to split the band into several channels.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The M3 mission is intended as a back-up candidate for the 2022 launch slot, depending on JUICE schedule.",0,,,,,,,,,
Although in the science programme the baseline launch slot for M3 is decision on the nominal launch date will be made following JUICE mission adoption.,1,,,,,,,,,
"In practice, this requirement with MR-MIS-040 means that there are daily launch windows between 14h and 15h30, apart from a ~1 month period around both equinoxes.",1,,,,,,,,,
"MR-MIS-100 After separation from the LV, the S/C shall autonomously activate one of its transmitting channels and its 2 receiving channels to allow the ESA ground station network to establish the first contact.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Although it will take about 1 month to arrive at a point 1.5 million km away from Earth, it will take about another 2 months before the amplitude and angle conditions expressed in MR-MIS-040 are verified.",1,,,,,,,,,
The post operations phase shall start from the end of the extended science operations phase and last for 2 years (TBC).,1,,,,,,,,,
"In the case that there is no extended science operations phase, the post operations phase shall start at the end of the nominal science operations phases.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The nominal mission lifetime, from LV (upper-stage) separation to the end of the nominal science operations phase, shall have a duration of 4 years.",1,,,,,,,,,
This mode will ensure science operations can be re-initiated “quickly” (e.g. within few hours) when needed.,1,,,,,,,,,
The pointing stability between the instrument LoS and the science target with the FGS in the control loop shall be controlled to ensure compliance with the noise and photometric stability requirement MR-PERF-350.,1,,,,,,,,,
A de-contamination mode shall ensure out-gassing and moisture release does not degrade the mission performance at any point during the mission.,1,,,,,,,,,
"This mode is necessary during LEOP and transfer to L2 to prevent contamination of the telescope and focal plane detectors during the initial out-gassing and moisture release of the S/C, but can also be re-used later during the mission lifetime to clean these units from any contaminants that might have accumulated since.",1,,,,,,,,,
"MR-PERF-030 During phases 4 and 5, the EChO S/C shall have the ability to make a rotation of 72 degrees around YECHO and observe a target from any of those attitudes.",1,,,,,,,,,
"MR-PERF-040 During phases 4 and 5, the EChO S/C shall have the ability to make a rotation of 2 degrees around XECHO and observe a target from any of those attitudes.",1,,,,,,,,,
MR-PERF-061 Corruption or loss of science data during a science observation shall be deducted from the observation efficiency budget with a degradation factor of 2.,1,,,,,,,,,
This loss can be due to e.g. reaction wheel spikes etc.,1,,,,,,,,,
The degradation factor is needed since a loss of X seconds during an observation out of transit means the equivalent X seconds in transit needed for the differential measurement are also lost.,1,,,,,,,,,
"MR-PERF-070 An average observation shall be defined as the observation of a single science target for 3.7 hours, separated by 90 degrees from the previous and the next science targets (TBC).",1,,,,,,,,,
Assuming that the platform can provide a coarse APE of 3’’ (3 sigma) means the FoV of the telescope and FGS shall be larger than ~7’’x7’’.,1,,,,,,,,,
Instrument requirements are derived for a classical dispersive/diffractive spectrometer design.,1,,,,,,,,,
"In case alternative designs are proposed (e.g. FTS), equivalent requirements shall be derived.",1,,,,,,,,,
These requirements give the wavelengths at which no cut between channels is allowed.,1,,,,,,,,,
The complete wavelength range can be split into as many channels as necessary as long as all science performance requirements are met.,1,,,,,,,,,
This should enable increasing the SNR at the expense of a reduced resolving power.,1,,,,,,,,,
Any reduction in one of these parameters shall be compensated by a proportional increase of either of the other 2 parameters.,1,,,,,,,,,
The minimum in-channel (i.e. not in the cut-off / overlap regions) figure of merit in any resolution element (as defined in MR-PERF-190) shall be no less than 80% of the figure of merit defined in MR-PERF-240.,1,,,,,,,,,
The minimum out-of-channel (i.e. in the overlap regions between 2 adjacent channels) figure of merit in any resolution element (as defined in MR-PERF-190) shall be no less than 50% of the figure of merit defined in MR-PERF-240.,1,,,,,,,,,
MR-PERF-242 can be achieved by the individual channels or by summing the response from 2 overlapping channels.,1,,,,,,,,,
MR-PERF-255 An extended FoV of ≥ 20’’ (half angle) in the spatial direction of each science channel shall enable the monitoring of the background (e.g. zodiacal and thermal background but also detector dark current) using off-source pixels (TBC).,1,,,,,,,,,
This is only required where the background is not negligible.,1,,,,,,,,,
MR-PERF-310 Stellar variability (post-processing) shall make a negligible contribution in RSS).,1,,,,,,,,,
"MR-PERF-330 and 340 can be achieved by observations of reference celestial objects, which are the same observations as those defined in MR-PERF-080.",1,,,,,,,,,
The zodiacal background contribution shall be evaluated using a worst case FoV per spectral bin of 10’’x10’’ (TBC) and the average zodi value as defined in MR- PERF-390.,1,,,,,,,,,
These values has been derived using the performance parameters defined equivalent relaxation to the noise requirement would be acceptable.,1,,,,,,,,,
Observation of stars with neighbouring sources that make a larger contribution is TBD.,1,,,,,,,,,
This means no additional budget needs to be apportioned to neighbouring sources in the total noise budget.,1,,,,,,,,,
"For instance, this implies [g], [microns] and [milliarcseconds] are acceptable.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The list of ESA approved standards, including approved ECSS standards, shall apply throughout the ECHO study, and is detailed in [AD4].",1,,,,,,,,,
"Single-point failures with a severity of catastrophic or critical (as defined in [AD4], ECSS-Q-ST-30C) shall be eliminated or prevented by design.",1,,,,,,,,,
"MR-SYS-190 Any hazardous situation, which will not cause immediate loss of but may develop into the loss of the S/C or instrument, shall be prevented by design or protected against.",1,,,,,,,,,
The design shall allow the identification of on-board failures and their recovery by autonomously switching to a redundant functional path.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Where this can be accomplished without risk to spacecraft and instrument safety, such switching shall enable the continuity of the mission timeline and performance.",1,,,,,,,,,
This means the design of fault management systems shall intrinsically be fail-safe.,1,,,,,,,,,
"MR-SYS-210 Where redundancy is employed, the design shall allow operation and verification of the redundant item/function, independent of nominal use.",1,,,,,,,,,
"In case of anomalies or failures from which an autonomous recovery is not possible, the S/C shall enter a Safe Mode to ensure S/C and instrument survival.",1,,,,,,,,,
These can be triggered by either S/C or instrument failures.,1,,,,,,,,,
The use of units inducing mechanical vibrations during science observations shall be avoided as far as practicable.,1,,,,,,,,,
"If approved, the supplier of such units shall characterise the generated vibration disturbances, and provide means of reducing these disturbances when necessary to ensure compliance with MR-MECH-030 and MR-PERF-350.",1,,,,,,,,,
"MR-AOCS-040 A Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) shall be implemented within the PLM, using the light focussed by the telescope, to meet the pointing stability requirement defined in MR-MIS-300.",1,,,,,,,,,
"The light shall be split between the first science instrument channel and the FGS, while ensuring the figures of merit defined in R-PERF-240 are not compromised.",1,,,,,,,,,
The S/C design shall enable operational control by the ground segment during all mission phases and modes in both nominal and contingency situations.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The MOC shall be responsible for the spacecraft operations after launch, including mission planning, spacecraft monitoring and control, and orbit and attitude determination and control.",1,,,,,,,,,
"In all mission phases after LEOP, the S/C shall be able to operate nominally without ground contact for at least 7 days, without any loss of science or housekeeping data.",1,,,,,,,,,
"In all mission phases after LEOP, the S/C shall be able to survive without ground contact for at least 11 days.",1,,,,,,,,,

To measure the shear from the galaxy ellipticities a tight control is imposed on possible instrumental effects and will lead to the variance of the shear systematic errors to be less than 10–7.,,1,,,,,,,,
"As well as the geometry, dark energy also affects the growth of structure.",,1,,,,,,,,
The combination of these two probes allows us to control and measure a wide range of systematics.,,1,,,,,,,,
"In particular the cross correlation between these two probes allows us to measure and mitigate astrophysical systematics, notably intrinsic alignments for weak lensing and galaxy bias for galaxy redshift surveys.",,1,,,,,,,,
"As well as breaking degeneracies in parameter space, a joint weak lensing and spectroscopic galaxy survey analysis is able to measure both Newtonian potentials, φ(k,z) and ψ(k,z), which describe the scalar (density) perturbations in a perturbed LFRW Universe, in order to provide constraints on modified gravity theories.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Conventional wisdom in the dark energy community, which is emphasized in both the DETF and ESA/ESA WGFC reports, is that high precision and accurate measurements will require a combi- nation of two or more probes.",,1,,,,,,,,
"According to Euclid’s first primary science objective (Table 1), the Figure of Merit (FoM) of the combination will be at least 500, which is 10-20 times higher than a DETF Stage II experiment, making Euclid at least a Stage IV experiment in the DETF scale.",,1,,,,,,,,
"In order to achieve the scien- tific objectives of Euclid as listed in Table 1, which require a FoM in excess of 500, the survey area of the WL and BAO surveys needs to cover a large fraction of the extragalactic sky of 20 000 deg2.",,1,,,,,,,,

"Identification of tens of thousands of galaxy clusters over a wide range of redshifts (up to z>2) to derive the evolution of their mass function and therefore place tight and independent constraints on w, σ8 and Ωm.",,1,,,,,,,,
"This requirement is essential to achieve the target accuracy on cosmological parameters, especially to achieve ~1% error on w. It results from trade-off studies aimed at the optimisation of the survey configuration to minimise the errors on dark energy parameters [RD02].",,1,,,,,,,,
The requirement can only be fulfilled if the extragalactic sky is covered at high galactic latitudes with b≥30 deg.,,1,,,,,,,,
"This is accomplished if the variance of the residual shear systematics is controlled This requirement is essential for the WL survey to reach the cosmological objectives, see [RD03].",,1,,,,,,,,
"This can be achieved with a spectroscopic subsample of about 105 galaxies representative of the WL sample [RD01, RD02].",,0,,,,,,,,
"In case of larger values of z, the BAO FoM will decrease significantly.",,1,,,,,,,,
The Euclid spectroscopic channel is considered not sensitive enough to fulfil the photo-z calibration requirement if one assumes a deep survey which is 2 mag deeper than the wide survey.,,1,,,,,,,,
The survey depth will be achieved by repeating about 40 times the observations of the same fields using the same wide survey observing modes.,,1,,,,,,,,
"The importance of the mission legacy depends on (1) the size and depth, (2) the spatial resolution, (3) the spectral resolution, and (4) wavelength coverage of the survey.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Besides its Dark-Energy-specific science goals, the combination by Euclid of imaging and spectro- scopy over 20,000 contiguous square degrees at high galactic latitude will result in an immense legacy value for the astronomy community, impacting a wide range of science topics.",,1,,,,,,,,
Euclid will therefore trace directly with exquisite statistics the evolution of galaxies within the dark/luminous scaffolding of the Universe measured respectively by weak lensing and galaxy redshifts.,,0,,,,,,,,
"Objects at z>5 and up to z~10 can be colour-selected from the Y, J, H photometry.",,1,,,,,,,,
Opportunities may arise during periods when the wide and deep surveys cannot be carried out in the nominal way.,,1,,,,,,,,
"For example, during the equinoxes, the galactic polar caps (b>30 degrees) are poorly visible, and these periods can be dedicated to Milky Way science.",,1,,,,,,,,
"Due to the longer expected lifetime of the NIR detectors, search for extra solar planets can be performed using only the NIR detectors during the later stages of the mission.",,1,,,,,,,,
The feasibility of additional science objectives depends on the implementation of the science requirements of the primary science objectives.,,1,,,,,,,,
Review of the assessment phase studies has lead to the recommendation that the mission is programmatically feasible only if mass of the payload has a sufficient margin of 30% for a Soyuz ST-2.1B launch from Kourou.,,1,,,,,,,,
This requirement together with requirement 4.2.1.3 enables to obtain the number density of resolved galaxies (i.e. with a size greater than the PSF) usable for the weak lensing analysis.,,,1,,,,,,,
"As long as the relative accuracy is met, the absolute photometric accuracy can be constructed from the data afterwards.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Requirement: the spectral range shall be 1.0-2.0 micron (required, <1.0 to >2.0 micron goal) to ensure the detection of spectral features expected for the redshift distributions of the galaxy samples.",,,1,,,,,,,
Requirement: A NIR image of the same field as covered by the slitless spectrograph shall be acquired with a depth which is sufficiently deep to always allow an association between an emission line (without continuum) detected in the dispersed image with a counterpart in the field image.,,,1,,,,,,,
"The direct image can be with a filter (J or H band being the obvious choice) or could be filter-less, thus exactly matching the slitless spectroscopy passband.",,,1,,,,,,,
"This approach requires accurate repeatability of the filter wheel holding the grism, since any non-repeatability must be at the level of small fractions of a pixel in order not to compromise the wavelength accuracy (a crucial requirement for the BAO experiment).",,,1,,,,,,,
"The survey depth in terms of AB magnitude limit shall be R+I+ZAB =24.5 (10σ extended source), assuming a PSF FWHM of 0.23 arcsec in this band.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Requirement: To meet the photometric redshift requirement, the depth in each of the Y, J and H NIR bands shall be 24 AB (5σ point source).",,,1,,,,,,,
"Requirement: at least 4 dithers shall be performed with the VIS imaging channel to cover the detector gaps such that 95% of the pixels of the coadded image has at least 3 exposures, and more than 60% of the pixels have 4 exposures.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Requirement: at least 4 dithers shall be performed for each band of the NIP channel for gap filling between the detectors and sub-pixel information, such that 95% of the pixels of the coadded image has at least 3 exposures, and more than 60% of the pixels has 4 exposures.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Dithering is needed in the visible and NIR ima- ging channels to fill the gaps between the detector arrays, to mitigate the effect of clusters of bad pixels, to improve the PSF calibration and galaxy shape measurement from sub-pixel information, to provide for a distortion map, and to allow for cross-correlations between exposures.",,,1,,,,,,,
"If we adopt the deep survey strategy as outlined below, the NIS data are not sufficiently deep to obtain a spectroscopic subsample of ~105 spectra for the NIP photo-z calibration down to AB=24 mag (cf Reqs.",,,1,,,,,,,
"One could think of the following survey strategy: if the catalogue selection is a random fraction of for example 33%, then 120 exposures of a given field would give an average total integration time of 6.3x6.3=40 exposures for all galaxy candidates in the field (2 mag = factor 6.3).",,,1,,,,,,,
"In case of slitless spectroscopy, there is no selection of the targets.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Given a sky coverage of 40 deg2, we expect to obtain spectra and derive spectroscopic redshifts for about 4 105 galaxies at 0 < z < 6 even with a low sampling rate of 10%.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Requirement: the deep-field spectroscopic survey shall have at least 105 galaxies with a limiting magnitude H(AB) = 24.0 mag in order to match the depth of the near-IR photometric channel and R+I+Z=24 mag (AB) corresponds to about H(AB)=24, depending of the colours of the targets (TBD).",,,1,,,,,,,
In this period it is possible to carry out 3-8 visits where an entire patch of 10 deg2 is covered.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Requirement: To meet the science objectives, the total wide survey area to be collected shall be more than 95% of the required area of 20,000 deg2.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Requirement: In case a nominal patch of 400 deg2 cannot be completed in the allocated amount of observing time at a given epoch, the “lost” fields shall be situated at the edge of the patch.",,,1,,,,,,,
"This means that “holes” should be avoided inside a patch due to “missed” fields, and rescheduling is necessary to trade the hole for a “lost” field at the edge of patch.",,,1,,,,,,,
"In case of a larger number of non-responsive detector arrays for VIS or NIP, and in case of one or more non- responsive detector arrays for NIS, the planned survey scanning strategy or the field observing sequence shall be modified.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Requirement: in case of the presence of clusters of bad pixels invalidating the dithering require- ment 4.5.1.5, the planned scanning strategy or the field observing sequence shall be modified.",,,1,,,,,,,
Any S/C (or transfer vehicle) shall not enter the “LEO protected zone” and the “GEO protected zone” after mission completion.,,,1,,,,,,,
"R-2.3.2-5: During the nominal science acquisition phase, the following spacecraft scale distances shall be established (In GSE coordinates: x is sun-Earth direction, y is East/West, z is North/South.",,,1,,,,,,,
"During the science acquisition phase, one scan shall be performed from 6,000 km (0.5y + commissioning time) to 3,000 km (0.5y) to 15,000 km (1y) to 6,000 km (till end of mission).",,,1,,,,,,,
R-2.3.9-3: All S/C shall be capable to receive and acknowledge commands from the ground at all times when communication links can be established.,,,1,,,,,,,
Telecommands generated by the ground segment shall be validated and transferred to the relevant users, time and event triggering shall be provided.,,,0,,,,,,
"R-2.3.10-5: Acquisition of housekeeping data shall be performed for all instruments and the platform subsystems, such that their state of health can be assessed at all times.",,,1,,,,,,,
Where this can be accomplished without risk to satellite safety such switching shall enable the continuity of the mission timeline and performance.,,,1,,,,,,,
"If the vehicles require additional post-manufacturing equipment, a declaration that required transformations have taken place should be submitted with the quotation.",,,1,,,,,,,
"To do so, key climate and carbon modeling users will be consulted to ensure the developed Land Cover products meet the requirements for a range of model communities and for application of existing and future modeling approaches (WP1100).",,,1,,,,,,,
"Issues of global, regional and national forest and land cover observations have recently received significant attention in a number of international processes on the political level, offering opportunities to improving relevance, acceptance, and approaches to operationalize global and regional land cover assessments.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Since technological progress and methodological sophistication alone is not sufficient to implement global land assessments effectively, particular emphasize on fostering more saliency and legitimacy of land cover observations is needed in addition to technical credibility.",,,1,,,,,,,
Any ECV monitoring effort has to ensure saliency and legitimacy in addition to technical credibility.,,,1,,,,,,,
"An international coordination mechanism among key actors worldwide (users, producers, science, regional/national experts) is essential to ensure that land cover products are accepted internationally and by the UNFCCC.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Reliable observations are crucial to monitor and understand the ongoing processes of deforestation, desertification, urbanization, land degradation, loss of biodiversity, ecosystem functions, water and energy management, and the influence of land cover changes on the physical climate system itself.",,,1,,,,,,,
The importance of these issues requires continuous monitoring systems and data.,,,1,,,,,,,
A climate model used to simulate these processes requires a proper determination of the land surface characteristics that are used in its parameterizations as boundary conditions.,,,1,,,,,,,
"While many IAMs have focused strongly on energy-economy systems and only included land use emissions as exogenous factors, this is now changing with the development and implementation of increasingly coupled socio- economic and climate modeling strategies.",,,1,,,,,,,
"These users are not partners in the project directly but could be engaged, in particular if involved in the user assessment of the products.",,,1,,,,,,,
This broad assessment of user requirements ensures that the full range of needs are considered and understood for deriving the detailed product specifications.,,,1,,,,,,,
New modeling concepts have triggered discussion to improve the existing land cover characterization and parameterization concepts.,,,1,,,,,,,
This broad assessment of user requirements ensures that the full range of needs are considered and understood for deriving the detailed product specification.,,,1,,,,,,,
"In addition, it will provide many of the essential observations required by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).",,,0,,,,,,,
LCCS classifiers enable better compatibility to be achieved between existing datasets and for future global monitoring systems.,,,1,,,,,,,
"It is dependent on the purpose of application of the land cover map, in this case land cover parameterization for the targeted user communities and their model requirements.",,,1,,,,,,,
"However, the independent accuracy assessment for monitoring land cover as ECV poses additional requirements and challenges.",,,1,,,,,,,
For the future there is need to develop the foundations and start implementing on operational monitoring that ensures that progressing annual global land cover datasets can assessed consecutively.,,,1,,,,,,,
"There is need for an independent quality assessment to ensure that the required standards are met, and that uncertainties are quantified and reduced as far as practicable.",,,1,,,,,,,
"While diversity and redundancy is useful for building a sustained global land cover monitoring system and to ensure flexibility in incorporating evolving technologies, there also needs to be an independent assessment mechanism led by the international community.",,,1,,,,,,,
"This mechanism should provide a comparative assessment and validation of individual products and work towards synergy to ensure that a common framework is used for global assessments, and that the “best global estimates” are made available based on the current stage of knowledge, data and information.",,,1,,,,,,,
"To this end, the project will also require the definition of a legend.",,,1,,,,,,,
"As part of this, to ensure full documentation, transparency and scientific stewardship in the generation (and update) of FCDRs and ECV products, the GCOS Steering Committee recommends that data producers pay particular attention to the 12 needs enumerated below and provided in the Guideline for the Generation of Datasets and Products Meeting GCOS Requirements (GCOS 2010a).",,,1,,,,,,,
These outputs require different sets of observations and monitoring approaches.,,,1,,,,,,,
The first set of observations enables quantification of the distribution and variability of CO2 fluxes between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Using constant conversion/expansion factors, as is usually done, results in large errors, since both wood density and expansion factors vary considerably with age and between species.",,,1,,,,,,,
"It is critical to harmonize the widely varying methodologies for inventory and analysis, in order to synthesize carbon estimates based on national forest inventories.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Fire distribution (hot spots) and burned area extent, to estimate the fluxes of carbon that are emitted during fires.",,,0,,,,,,,
Also differences in spatial and temporal resolution are regarded as reasons for interoperability problems.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Furthermore, the allocation of model parameters and the transformation of land cover data to other information, due to interpolation issues, remains a source of inaccuracy.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Due to these classification and resolution (temporal and spatial) problems, difficulties and inaccuracies arise in attempts to create combined datasets for running climate models if datasets for the historic period and present day situation are combined used as model input for studies on future scenario’s.",,,,1,,,,,,
"For one user where models are applied to different spatial extends, the accuracy of the land cover products is rated very good to moderate.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Going from current to future model requirements, a trend towards an increase in required spatial resolution of land cover datasets can be identified (Figure 14).",,,,0,,,,,,
"However, the introduction of new modeling approaches will require temporal frequencies for some classes up to a monthly resolution.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Furthermore, in order to improve current models and feed improved model approaches within 5 years, higher demands are put on the temporal ranges available of input data.",,,,1,,,,,,
"For some global models, temporal ranges up to 10.000 years will be required.",,,,1,,,,,,
"To produce accurate model output with relatively short simulation steps, historical data of high quality (spatial and temporal resolution) is required.",,,,1,,,,,,
"In case the key-users use and/ or require multi-temporal land cover data for parameter estimations, the preferred seasonally.",,,,1,,,,,,
"For future modeling practices on defining human activities and land cover dynamics, the following land cover classes will become important : crop and pasture/ grassland varieties (C3, C4), irrigated areas, forest, urban areas, specific agricultural land management practices and fire activity.",,,,1,,,,,,
Also the data format that is most convenient for land cover products was suggested uniformly as NetCDF.,,,,1,,,,,,
"For land cover data delivery, the most popular delivery method is identified as the FTP server or a combination of web services and a FTP server.",,,,1,,,,,,
For different land surface parameters the pattern of class similarity is rather different.,,,,1,,,,,,
"For Albedo, there are a few classes that obviously have a very different value (Snow, ice, water) than many of the other classes that are relatively similar.",,,,1,,,,,,
"For the forest ratio, there is more of an equal distribution among the range of similarity values.",,,,1,,,,,,
This highlights that the relative importance and thus accuracy of land cover categories for model parameterization varies depending on what model parameter is estimated from the data.,,,,1,,,,,,
To provide some information we have grouped the classes into major land cover categories used for previous global land cover comparison studies and somewhat reflecting the GTOS requirements for land cover (Herold 2008).,,,,1,,,,,,
The areas with pink table cells have the highest average similarities among all land surface parameters.,,,,1,,,,,,
A misclassification and confusion between two classes with large similarity will cause a much lower error in the quantitative parameter estimation than uncertainties among very dissimilar classes.,,,,1,,,,,,
"When looking more specific at information requirements on human activities/disturbances or dynamics (Figure 24), the outcome of the survey shows that currently forest loss, agricultural expansion and vegetation phenology are important processes which are taking into account in the initialization or evaluation step of the climate models.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Within the modeling process, land cover products are also adopted to determine land surface parameters which are then use to initialize the climate models.",,,,1,,,,,,
"For future modeling applications, land cover data will increasingly be adopted to validate net primary production (NPP), albedo and LAI.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The results are presented below and are, where applicable, linked to GCOS tasks for land cover as defined in the GCOS implementation plan.",,,,1,,,,,,
In a more general sense it is stated that parameters must be used that are both mechanistically important and measurable (Ostle et al.,,,,1,,,,,,
This need to validate parameters requires (new) methods for land cover map accuracy assessments (Williams et al.,,,,1,,,,,,
This may increase the reliability of for example the model estimated European carbon balance in the future (Vetter et al.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Per definition, it is not possible to correctly interpret carbon cycle simulations if the overall-, user-, and producer accuracy is not known (Jung et al.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Therefore, there is an urgent need for a network of ground and satellite based long term land cover monitoring (Jain and Yang 2005).",,,,0,,,,,,
"Thereby, the benchmarking of global models is a key-procedure and an expanded set of data for evaluation of short timescale dynamics for benchmarking is required (Sitch et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
"Furthermore, the scientific community suggested to further expand the FLUXNET tower network to obtain critical data on carbon exchange (Williams et al.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Therefore, the in 2004 defined GCOS task 26 which focuses on the creation of annual land cover products and GCOS task 27 which focuses on the creation of a regular fine resolution land cover (change) map, are still relevant and urgent tasks that should be dealt with on the short term.",,,,0,,,,,,
"To advance scientific understanding and enhance data- and model integration, the earth system modeling and integrated assessment modeling communities have to collaborate closely with the remote sensing community (Hibbard et al.",,,,1,,,,,,
"By accounting for a number of additional anthropogenic climate impacts, land cover forcing can be included which will improve the quality of regional climate assessments as e.g. IPCC SRES scenarios (Feddema et al.",,,,0,,,,,,
"In addition, it is stated that without accounting for historical land cover changes, observed atmosphere CO2 growth cannot be explained (Brovkin et al.",,,,1,,,,,,
This implies the need to incorporate historical land cover change into carbon exchange/ stock models.,,,,0,,,,,,
"Linked to the requirement for earth system modeling to incorporate land cover change, the decline in land suitability due to soil erosion, acidification and salinization also need to be taken into account (Ramankutty et al.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Besides a better understanding of the required model inputs, a more process based understanding of earth system and climate models is needed.",,,,0,,,,,,
There is a need to critically evaluate the representation of plant-soil processes in global models (Ostle et al.,,,,0,,,,,,
"As a part of obtaining more knowledge on the models’ process understanding, more research should be done on model equifinality: where different model representations, through parameters or model structures, yield similar effects on model outputs, and so can be difficult to distinguish (Williams et al.",,,,1,,,,,,
"For the long term (> 5 years), defined requirements are strongly process based.",,,,1,,,,,,
Nitrogen supply from soil organic matter is not known accurately and introduces uncertainty (Ostle et al.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Due to an increase in greenhouse gases the area of land that is cultivable might increase, but yields might decrease.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Up till now, the effects of land-cover change on climate has been difficult because different bio- geophysical effects offset each other in terms of climate impacts, and, on global and annual scales, regional impacts are often of opposite sign and are therefore not well represented in annual global average statistics (Feddema et al.",,,,1,,,,,,
"While it is assumed that any new land cover datasets should be better than previous ones and improve climate model and assessment performance, there are several ways land cover feed into different climate applications.",,,,0,,,,,,
Consistency is the key requirement and thus one fundamental (land cover) dataset is the base for series parameters.,,,,1,,,,,,
This puts more burden on the accuracy of the land cover data since related errors propagate to all parameters.,,,,1,,,,,,
More process oriented models need less data for input/calibration but more for validation of outputs.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Given the fact that available land cover maps have an overall area weighted accuracy of around 70%, it can be assumed that the accuracy requirements for the land cover CCI should be higher.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Secondly, GCOS requirements mention a maximum of 15 % omission / commission per class, those from CMUG and the CCI an error of 5-10 CMUG further requires stability in accuracies over time of less than 10% (Table 5).",,,,1,,,,,,
The accuracy of the products depends on its actual use in the model.,,,,1,,,,,,
"First, there is not one spatial resolution that fits all purposes; it is important that the land cover product provides flexibility to serve different scales and purposes.",,,,1,,,,,,
"This would mean that land cover observations to estimate model parameters and for description of change would need towards fine-scale satellite observations coming from Landsat- type observations in the coming years (e.g., Sentinel-2).",,,,0,,,,,,
"Given the fact that users require a suite of different types of land cover categories (or plant functional types) for model parameterization that varies with type of model and modeling approach, any land cover product will need to provide some flexibility in responding to these different thematic needs.",,,,1,,,,,,
To reduce the uncertainty for parameters which are derived from remote sensing datasets (i.e. C3/C4 separation) the use of external products or non-satellite derived data maybe needed in addition if it improves accuracy and parameter estimation procedures.,,,,1,,,,,,
"For example, for the models operated at MPI-M (JS-BACH, REMO), all Olson classes (or fractions of), that are transferred into grasses, the separation into C3 and C4 grasses is conducted is based on work by Knorr (1997).",,,,1,,,,,,
"This re-emphasizes that fact that there is need for both stable and accurate land cover, and dynamic component reflecting time-series and changes.",,,,0,,,,,,
This would allow to identify pixels which are less reliable (representative) and would give the possibility to make sub-classes for these pixels.,,,,0,,,,,,
This information is used to make a choice on which land cover dataset is used in the climate model and for interpretation of climate modeling results in case biases can be related to land cover information in the simulation of associated variables.,,,,1,,,,,,
"As a next step, more spatial explicit quality estimates are required: per pixel probability for a land cover class and the anticipated second class.",,,,0,,,,,,
"However, to include these variables into climate models more adequate formats would be required which allow usage in scripting.",,,,1,,,,,,
"From the user information available, the key climate users require NetCDF as format, while the broad users and a bit more than 40 % of the associated users require GEOtiff as suitable data format to meet their needs (Figure 34).",,,,1,,,,,,
"This direction necessitates a much stronger of the land component in terms spatial, temporal and thematic detail and related requirements for land cover and land use data.",,,,1,,,,,,
"In order to provide a comprehensive overview of the user requirements for the different ECVs, ESA has provided a standard template for presentation.",,,,1,,,,,,
There is a need for both stable land cover data and a dynamic component (time-series and changes).,,,,0,,,,,,
"Q6: For which land cover changes are you mostly interested in, if any?",,,,1,,,,,,
"For efficiency reasons, a different approach has been presented by Tessella.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Where necessary, user requirements defined in different stages will be identified as such.",,,,1,,,,,,
"As the work has a research element, and project decisions will be made based on produced results during the project, it is difficult to estimate precisely how long the development of each stage will take.",,,,1,,,,,,
"As a result, the implementation of these components will depend on time available.",,,,0,,,,,,

"Once an initial version of the system is produced that fulfils the above capabilities, it will be extended with a library of emulated components, and a controller to interconnect these components.",,,,1,,,,,,

The purpose of the Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to describe the different requirements for the Bank of Zambia’s (BoZ) envisioned Data Reporting and Analytics platform.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The information has been captured and written through technical support from UNCDF MM4P and signed- off by the relevant stakeholders at BoZ, validating the requirements meet their core business needs.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Having validated the structure and contents of the document, the below stakeholders are signing-off on their specific business requirements.",,,,,1,,,,,
"It is also one of the original 17 regulatory institutions to make specific national commitments to financial inclusion under the Maya Declaration, during the Global Policy Forum, held in Riviera Maya, Mexico in 2011.",,,,,1,,,,,
BoZ has deployed various policies to ensure that financial services are able to make in-roads in remote and rural areas.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Zambia was the earliest adopter of digital financial services (DFS) in Africa in 2002, and the country has made significant improvements over the years in terms of financial services delivery outlets/channels offered through both formal and informal financial institutions.",,,,,1,,,,,
The Bank of Zambia realizes the important catalytic role that Digital Financial Services (DFS) can play towards the increased usage of electronic payment mechanisms by the general public.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The Bank of Zambia is therefore working with government and other private and public stakeholders to increase financial inclusion, by increasing access to formal financial services.",,,,,1,,,,,
To this effect the Bank has amongst its strategic objective include plans to increase formal financial inclusion.,,,,,1,,,,,
A number of initiatives have since been put into motion in order to meet this objective.,,,,,1,,,,,
"To ensure integrity of the Digital Financial Services (DFS) sector and enhancing of financial access and usage, Bank of Zambia recognizes it is important that data and measurement tools are deployed for aiding effective supervision and policy making.",,,,,1,,,,,
"With its capital mandate and instruments, UNCDF offers “last mile” finance models that unlock public and private resources, especially at the domestic level, to reduce poverty and support local economic development.",,,,,1,,,,,
This last mile is where available resources for development are scarcest, where market failures are most pronounced, and where benefits from national growth tend to leave people excluded.,,,,,1,,,
Mobile Money for the Poor (MM4P) is a global thematic initiative to address the opportunities and challenges of implementing branchless banking and mobile money in challenging markets in Africa and Asia.,,,,,1,,,,,
"MM4P’s long-term mission is to help low income and rural households in LDCs increase their financial security through appropriate, affordable and secure means to receive, manage and save money through these “digital financial services” (DFS).",,,,,1,,,,,
"In Zambia, MM4P launched its program in March 2015, funded by both MasterCard Foundation, is aimed at increasing active usage of DFS from the current 3% to 36% by 2019 amongst the adult population.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In order to discharge these functions, the Bank needs a robust Data Reporting and Analytics platform (hereinafter “the Platform”) that will support its monitoring and policy making activities.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Consequently, the ‘Banking Currency and Payment Systems Department’ at BoZ, with support from UNCDF Zambia, seeks to deploy a Data Reporting and Analytics platform that would automate the reporting processes and provide analytics useful for policy making.",,,,,0,,,,,
BoZ collects a significant magnitude of data from financial service providers to carry out its regulatory obligations and policy making function.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Staff at Payment System then collects more than 50 excel files from 34 reporting institutions to manually aggregate the data from these sheets to prepare monthly, quarterly and yearly performance reports.",,,,,1,,,,,
The monthly reporting process takes a dedicated resource nearly a week to complete and an additional week is required when quarter and year-end reports are prepared.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Needless to say, the current process of manually entering, extracting, compiling, aggregating, analysing and reporting data creates numerous challenges for both; BoZ and reporting institutions.",,,,,1,,,,,
"BoZ seeks to implementing a secure, flexible, scalable solution that automates the data collection, analysis and reporting process.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Once the data has been collected and cleansed, it will be stored in a secure database and the analytical functionality would create intelligence in the form of dashboards, visualizations and reports (adhoc & routine).",,,,,1,,,,,
"Where the following sections of the BRD are based on more traditional approach, UNCDF is open to explore solutions that leverage innovative technologies for regulatory reporting, such as blockchain, provided these meet requirements set by BoZ and offers additional advantages in term of functionality and costs.",,,,,1,,,,,
The Bank in a bid to enhance operational efficiency and effectiveness will implement an Enterprise Architecture (EA) Framework2.,,,,,1,,,,,
The EA Framework will assist the Bank to respond better to its stakeholders by having a method and an organising principle that aligns functional business objectives and strategy with an IT strategy and execution plan.,,,,,1,,,,,
The Bank will also seek to implement greater integration among its information systems by implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform.,,,,,1,,,,,
Some of the benefits of the ERP include reduction in complexity of the Bank's Information Architecture through the establishment of a single platform for the Bank's business systems.,,,,,1,,,,,
"In the ideal scenario the data warehouse could utilize Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) methodologies for analytical analysis and allowing users to construct queries ad-hoc, or “on-the-fly”.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Furthermore, the platform should allow it incorporate more features as business needs and technology evolves.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The long-term vision of the platform includes straight-through processing of data from reporting institutions with minimal intervention to ensure data accuracy, integrity and timeliness.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In a bid to enhance operational efficiency and effectiveness, BoZ has plans to implement an Enterprise Architecture (EA) Framework.",,,,,1,,,,,
The platform therefore should consider all interdependencies and linkages that will be required as components of the new framework are introduced.,,,,,0,,,,,
The data will need to reside in the Bank of Zambia in-house server as per Bank of Zambia policies and requirements.,,,,,1,,,,,
BoZ seeks to enhance the efficiency of the data collection and analytics to ensure quality and timeliness of data.,,,,,1,,,,,
The platform will provide functionality for managing and restricting system access according to each user group’s access privileges as authorised by BoZ.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Limit access to the platform only to authorised and uniquely identified users by enforce authentication that can be based on combination of user/password or user certificate Manage and monitor privileges of users, allowing them access to features, sensitive data and outputs as per their privileges.",,,,,1,,,,,
"To accommodate the different user groups, the platform will enforce user hierarchies and access controls to prevent unauthorised access to sensitive data and features.",,,,,1,,,,,
"BoZ collects a large amount of data for statistical, prudential and monitoring purposes.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Once the deployed, users from multiple reporting institutions will interact with the platform, through a secure web-based, to enter the required regulatory reporting data.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Before the data is submitted to BoZ, the platform will check input values to ensure conformity to the defined business rules.",,,,,1,,,,,
"If the submitted data/report is in conflict with the business rules, then the platform will display the appropriate error message that will allow user to identify and adjust the erroneous entries.",,,,,1,,,,,
"To ensure a harmonized model for input data as well as rules for analysis of collected data, the platform should operate as per the criteria and conditions defined by BoZ in the form of Business Rules.",,,,,1,,,,,
"As reporting requirements can evolve with new regulatory priorities, the platform should provide the capability to define and modify business rules through the administrator login.",,,,,1,,,,,
"To that end, the platform should be capable of handling complex multi-dimensional data and have robust data analysis and modelling capability would gain a better understanding of the relationships between disparate pieces of data.",,,,,1,,,,,
"This will allow BoZ to proactively manage the DFS sector and gain a better understanding of the relationships between disparate pieces of data, particularly on matters related to gender and youth.",,,,,0,,,,,
"The platform will provide additional ad-hoc data access functionality to users so they may run custom queries, according to their access privileges.",,,,,1,,,,,
The platform would have the ability to generate a variety of decision making tools in different formats that would help BoZ and other stakeholders assess the performance of the DFS sector and make strategic decisions.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Accessible through web-browsers, the user interface should be windows-compatible and provide access to all platform features and modules.",,,,,1,,,,,
The design should have a high level of usability with a common “look and feel” achieved through consistent Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) for all internal and external users.,,,,,1,,,,,
Incorporate data entry features designed to reduce the amount of direct keying required to enter data.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The platform solution must be scalable upwards and designed using modular architecture to accommodate increasing number of users, sessions, transactions, and analytical reports as need.",,,,,1,,,,,
"To ensure integrity of the platform, all its components should have all required security certifications and conform to all industry security standards.",,,,,1,,,,,
The platform must be easy to use in order to minimize a chance of human error leading to a malfunctioning of the system.,,,,,1,,,,,
"At the minimum, the platform has to be available to users with official working hours in Zambia.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In the ideal scenario, the platform should be capable of creating required reports within 10 seconds and allow replacing the back-end queries to be able to override slow performing queries with optimized queries.",,,,,1,,,,,
The platform should provide high reliability and ensure flawless switching of all functionalities to the Disaster Recovery (DR) site to avoid catastrophic loss of critical information.,,,,,1,,,,,
The platform should be designed with high redundancy level to ensure no or little impact by failure of one or more components.,,,,,1,,,,,
"These user requirements were established according to requests formulated by Group ODE taking into account the wishes of our customer, Egbert Teeselink, on behalf of Oc´e.",,,,,1,,,,,
During the project the group will create a tool in which Oc´e’s software engineers can model a datapath.,,,,,1,,,,,
Any changes to these requirements require the consent of both parties.,,,,,1,,,,,
The ODE Group will provide Oc´e with an editor where the user can model a so called datapath.,,,,,1,,,,,
The ODE will provide a visual environment in which the user can create and change these models and export them for analysis.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Because it is irrelevant of which actions the analysis and veriﬁcation tools consist, it is depicted as an abstract “Analysis” object.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The Speciﬁc requirements are subdivided in capability requirements, describing what the system should do, and constraint requirements, describing how the requirements should be implemented.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The ODE will provide a graphical interface for designing models representing datapaths, which can be exported and analysed by other software.",,,,,1,,,,,
The ODE should provide the user with a visual way of modelling datapaths and it should also allow the user to export this model to a ﬁle for analysis and veriﬁcation.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The model editor will provide a visual way to model datapaths consisting of an application part, a platform and a mapping that maps the application onto the platform.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The repository will allow the user to add and edit speciﬁc tasks, algorithms and hardware types in text.",,,,,1,,,,,
"This part of the ODE provides a GUI in which the user can model an application, a platform and a mapping that maps the application onto the platform.",,,,,1,,,,,
The entire structure of the model has yet to be deﬁned and is prone to change after this project has been ﬁnished.,,,,,1,,,,,
"However, some details about the structure of various nodes and edges are known and unlikely to change during the course of this project.",,,,,1,,,,,
The algorithm speciﬁes how eﬃcient a task can be executed on this piece of hardware.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The repository is included to allow users to add, edit and remove deﬁned algorithms, resources and tasks.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Because the export format and the input language are prone to modiﬁcations, it is important that future developers can easily modify the code to comply with new standards.",,,,,1,,,,,
Therefore the quality standards for the source code of the ODE are high.,,,,,0,,,,,
"However, it may check for basic validity of models created with the ODE and provide constraints within its GUI to prevent some basic syntactical errors.",,,,,1,,,,,
These users are also very important since the export format and the product’s required functionality are prone to change.,,,,,1,,,,,
The product will run on computer systems running either Windows XP or Windows 7 as primary operating system.,,,,,1,,,,,
"In order for us to be able to provide a good product, we expect the customer to comply to several requirements.",,,,,1,,,,,
The language to be used in the models is frozen before the end of the SR.,,,,,1,,,,,
Must have: these requirements are essential for the product.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Must haves, meaning they must be implemented if at all possible.",,,,,1,,,,,
Could have: requirements which are not critical to the products success.,,,,,0,,,,,
It is possible to select any application node or platform node by means of a method call.,,,,,1,,,,,
It is possible to highlight any application node or platform node by means of a method call.,,,,,1,,,,,
Other programs can send messages to the product for selecting and highlighting edges and nodes.,,,,,1,,,,,
The editor supports alignment of any element (such as application nodes and platform nodes) relative to similar elements in its vicinity.,,,,,1,,,,,
"When two nodes are copied which have an edge between them, this edge is copied along.",,,,,1,,,,,
The editor will assign an algorithm to a link if there is exactly one algorithm available for it.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Every method and class in the source-code is documented using comments, explaining what it does, and how it does this.",,,,,1,,,,,
There is a unit test for every method or class that is not directly responding to a mouse-click or keystroke.,,,,,1,,,,,
The ODE does not measurably suﬀer from memory leaks.,,,,,1,,,,,
The requirements in the OAD (RD2) will flow down to requirements for the observatory subsystems.,,,,,1,,,,,
"As necessary, new requirements implied by the current document flow down into OAD (RD2).",,,,,1,,,,,
This numbering scheme allows for unambiguous reference to requirements.,,,,,1,,,,,
The requirements documented in the OPSRD and the ORD (RD1) are intended to fully describe the top-level engineering and operational requirements to satisfy the criteria of the Science Requirements Document (SRD) (RD3) and Operations Plan (RD4).,,,,,1,,,,,
"By this definition, the OPSRD will change in response to changes in the Operations Plan (RD4), but will not require modification when changes are made to the Observatory Requirements Document (ORD) (RD1), Observatory Architecture Document (OAD) (RD2), or to the Subsystem Requirements Documents.",,,,,1,,,,,
Early operations is defined as the period that starts when the first nontechnical facilities are accepted and continues until the observatory has reached steady-state operations.,,,,,1,,,,,
Early science operations are expected to begin during the first 12 months after the M1 has been fully populated and phased for the first time.,,,,,1,,,,,
Steady-state (science) operations is defined as the period that starts 36 (TBC) months after the M1 has been fully populated and phased for the first time.,,,,,1,,,,,
The intervening time is considered sufficient for tuning the performance and operational procedures to the level necessary to meet the requirements in this section.,,,,,1,,,,,
Nighttime is defined as the time between the end of evening nautical twilight and the beginning of morning nautical twilight.,,,,,1,,,,,
"At these points, the center of the sun is 12 degrees below the horizon.",,,,,0,,,,,
"For Mauna Kea, this time interval corresponds to roughly 10 hours per 24-hour period in the mean.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Term Definition Shall ""Shall"" derequirements that are mandatory and will be the subject of specific acceptance testing and compliance verification.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Can/May/Should ""Can"", ""May"", or ""Should"" indicate recommendations and are not subject to any requirement acceptance testing or compliance verification by the supplier.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Is/Will ""Is"" or ""Will"" indicate a statement of fact or provide information and are not subject to any requirement acceptance testing or verification compliance by the supplier.",,,,,1,,,,,
The development of TMT Observatory operational requirements is motivated by several key measurable metrics of success.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Conceptually, a high-impact paper contains transformational and/or unique scientific results.",,,,,1,,,,,
"To maximize scientific success as measured by the metrics above, the TMT Observatory will strive for technical excellence as measured by the following technical success metrics.",,,,,1,,,,,
High-impact papers often result from exploiting unique observatory capabilities.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Conversely, it is well recognized that observatories that do not add new capabilities over time quickly become scientifically irrelevant, often limiting the overall scientific return on the original capital investment.",,,,,1,,,,,
"By design, the TMT Observatory will be first in its class in many areas at the start of operations.",,,,,1,,,,,
"To maintain its lead in as many areas as possible within available funding, the TMT Observatory will execute a vigorous development program during the operations phase.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In particular, this program will endeavor to provide the TMT Observatory with a steady flow of new and unique instruments and AO systems commensurate with the evolving ambitions of the TMT user community.",,,,,1,,,,,
"As the number of science integration hours decreases, so does the potential for transformational observations.",,,,,1,,,,,
"As system performance degrades, so does the scientific grasp of TMT and hence its potential for transformational observations.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Discussion: If required, TMT will provide technical feasibility evaluation at the proposal phase for individual instruments and AO systems, however it will be up to each partner to assess their observing proposals.",,,,,1,,,,,

Discussion: Backup observing programs will be prepared for all TMT observing service queue programs in the event that weather conditions or technical failures prevent the execution of the primary science program.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Discussion: For multi-aperture instruments, an automatic field acquisition and fine alignment system will be incorporated which enables final alignment of the mask with the target field.",,,,,1,,,,,
The TMT Observatory in steady-state operations shall have no more than 3% unscheduled technical downtime between the end of evening nautical twilight and the start of morning nautical twilight during hours scheduled for science operations.,,,,,1,,,,,
Discussion: Scheduled technical time will be publicly announced and taken into account when the observatory science operations schedule is constructed.,,,,,1,,,,,
Discussion: All instruments declared to be operational are expected to have unscheduled technical downtimes commensurate with the above system level requirement.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Any time loss due to failures of the telescope, instruments, adaptive optics systems or science observing software which prevent useful science observing with a reasonable efficiency and performance will be counted as unscheduled technical Downtime.",,,,,1,,,,,
The TMT Observatory available science time on the telescope for observing planning purposes shall be assumed to be 50% of time for seeing limited observations and 50% of the time for diffraction limited observations (using AO).,,,,,1,,,,,
The TMT Observatory shall monitor operational metrics to identify potential improvements and monitor observing efficiency and other telescope performance metrics.,,,,,1,,,,,
Discussion: Baseline image quality performance will be established during TMT integration and verification.,,,,,1,,,,,

The TMT observatory shall provide a master alarm monitor that shows TMT subsystem status.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The TMT status will be in an easily interpretable form, e.g., a screen showing a red (alarm) or green (operational) bar for each major sub-system.",,,,,1,,,,,
The TMT observatory storage systems shall provide sufficient storage to retain the science data and associated calibration data for the life of the observatory.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Discussion: If there are TMT external archives or data centers, the storage systems will be able to retain the most recent two years of science datasets.",,,,,1,,,,,
The TMT observatory science data and metadata shall support enforcement of an 18 month (TBC) proprietary period after delivery to the PI.,,,,,1,,,,,
The TMT observatory science data and metadata shall be made accessible to the worldwide community after the standard proprietary period is over.,,,,,1,,,,,
The TMT Observatory shall provide data reduction disk space and computing capability on remotely accessible observatory computers.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The TMT observatory science and/or calibration data shall be processed by TMT Observatory for the following reasons: to confirm target acquisition before observation begins; and to assess data quality (e.g. signal-to-noise ratio, delivered image quality in science instrument focal plane) during observation and as part of observatory system performance monitoring program.",,,,,1,,,,,
Discussion: Self-contained in this context means that the modules will run without depending on observatory software.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The TMT Observatory processing pipelines shall be used for quick- look reductions, target acquisition during observing and system performance monitoring.",,,,,1,,,,,
The TMT Observatory in steady-state science operations shall minimize the amount of night time needed for acquiring calibration data.,,,,,1,,,,,
The TMT Observatory AO system night time calibration shall consume no more than 1% of the scheduled observing time.,,,,,1,,,,,

The TMT Observatory shall ensure that sufficient calibration data is obtained to meet minimum standards in the context of a scientifically useful archive.,,,,,1,,,,,
It will be the responsibility of the individual users (or teams) to review the on-going calibration program and decide whether or not to obtain additional calibration data tailored to their specific needs as part of their own observing programs.,,,,,1,,,,,
The TMT Observatory shall enable operations of multiple instruments in parallel for the purposes of instrument configuration and calibration.,,,,,1,,,,,
The TMT Observatory performance monitoring on-sky calibrations shall be made available for science calibration and accounted under general technical time.,,,,,1,,,,,
Discussion: Individual users may need to obtain additional calibration data.,,,,,1,,,,,
"If so, they must request sufficient time for these calibrations as part of their original observing proposal.",,,,,0,,,,,
The TMT Observatory subsystems (including instruments) are required to produce status and diagnostic telemetry for the purposes of performance monitoring and failure analysis.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Discussion: To meet this requirement, the telemetry information needs to include both low-level (e.g. hydrostatic bearing pressures) and high-level (e.g. delivered image quality) information.",,,,,,1,,,,

The purpose of this document [EURD] is to define the End-User Requirements applicable to the Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) Programme.,,,,,,1,,,,
Actual performances of the services of the system will be described in the Operational Services Specification after the system has been commissioned.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The ""MTG Products Distribution Baseline [MTGDIS]"" (EUM/MTG/DOC/17/946090) is an appendix of the [EURD] aiming to define the Level 1 and Level 2 datasets that will be disseminated and archived at EUMETSAT Headquarters as part of the Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) Programme.",,,,,,1,,,,

"The Quality threshold is met when the requirements on Completeness, Accuracy and Timeliness are fulfilled.",,,,,,1,,,,
This implies that a short outage preventing a repeat cycle to be completed on time has to be considered as an outage of the whole repeat cycle.,,,,,,1,,,,
"A dataset is complete if no data has been lost since its generation, unless a requirement in the product specification or service specification allows some losses (e.g. missing samples).",,,,,,1,,,,
The scheduled outages are due to planned operations or predictable events.,,,,,,1,,,,

Some ground segment maintenance may not be achievable without service interruption (e.g. to swap between a prime and redundant service).,,,,,,1,,,,
These interruptions are sporadic over the year and their exact duration depends on the disseminated dataset and maintenance activity performed.,,,,,,1,,,,
"During the eclipse season the dataset quality will be degraded for some channels and/or a part of the coverage, however no interruption of the dataset acquisition and dissemination is foreseen.",,,,,,1,,,,
The quality degradation around the eclipse is primarily due to stray light and thermal effects.,,,,,,1,,,,

"For the IRS: A spectral sounding is deemed a missing sounding if either no measurement has been returned or a fraction of the spectral channels greater than M, within the considered spectral band, have associated radiance samples where the difference between the radiometric error and the radiometric accuracy is more than N times the specified radiometric noise, for a specific repeat cycle.",1,,,,,,,,,
The parameters M and N are given in the requirement for missing sounding.,1,,,,,,,,,

Together the spatial properties are referred to as the spatial sample or pixel depending on whether the radiance sample has been located on the estimated grid or the reference grid respectively.,1,,,,,,,,,
Together the spectral properties are referred to as the spectral sample or spectral channel depending on whether the radiance sample is located according to a reference spectral location and spectral response function.,1,,,,,,,,,
The spectral channel is fixed by the optical and detector element spectral filtering characteristics.,1,,,,,,,,,
Thus for each spatial sample of a spectral channel a single radiance sample is measured.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Once the spectral sounding interferogram has been Fourier transformed to the spectral domain a series of spectral samples are obtained, each with its own radiance sample.",1,,,,,,,,,
"For the LI: A single spectral channel is defined, thus each spatial sample has an associated radiance sample.",1,,,,,,,,,
"In the case of the IRS the PSF of the spatial sample will vary with the spectral sample or spectral channel, although the nominal location will be the same across the spectral variable range.",1,,,,,,,,,
For the IRS: Spectral samples are obtained by performing a discrete Fourier Transform of the sampled spectral sounding interferogram for a spatial sample.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The spectral sample, identified by the index k, has an associated spectral variable, ξ k, where this location corresponds to the position of its spectral response function centroid.",1,,,,,,,,,
As the IRS will perform a number of spectral soundings simultaneously there will be a scale change between the spectral spacing of the spectral samples for each spatial sample.,1,,,,,,,,,
This is due to the change in maximum optical path difference caused by the position of a spatial sample in relation to the optical axis.,0,,,,,,,,,
Thus each spatial sample will have spectral samples taken at a set of wavenumbers specific to that spatial sample.,1,,,,,,,,,
The spectral sample surface is defined as the group of spectral samples with the same index number following the discrete Fourier transform of all the spectral sounding interferograms in an area of coverage.,1,,,,,,,,,

"For the IRS: Spectral resampling is the process by which the spectral samples derived from a sampled interferogram are relocated to pre-determined wavenumber locations, thus forming spectral channels.",1,,,,,,,,,
In the definition of IRF the instruments are assumed to be linear.,1,,,,,,,,,
Another consequence of the definition is the fact that the integral of SRF along the spectral variable is unity.,1,,,,,,,,,
A spectral sounding is defined as the complete set of spectral samples for any fixed spatial sample captured during a dwell of a sounder.,1,,,,,,,,,
"For a given spectral value, reflectance is the ratio between the power per unit surface area emitted by a surface and the power per unit surface area (irradiance) incident on the surface.",1,,,,,,,,,
"For a given spectral interval, albedo is the ratio between the power per unit surface area emitted by a surface and the power per unit surface area incident on the surface.",1,,,,,,,,,
"In this definition the measured effective radiance is assumed to contain calibration related errors and radiometric noise contributions, whereas the reference effective radiance is derived using a perfectly characterised reference spectral response function viewing a scene, traceable to a radiometric standards (e.g. National Physical Laboratory (UK)), with zero radiometric noise contribution.",1,,,,,,,,,
When expressed in this form the radiometric noise is given as noise equivalent delta radiance (NEdL).,1,,,,,,,,,

The radiometric scaling function is used to derive radiometric requirements for measurement conditions different from the reference case.,1,,,,,,,,,
For the FCI IR spectral channels the medium term radiometric stability is the radiometric stability between any two images lying in the interval between two calibration cycles.,1,,,,,,,,,
For the FCI VIS/NIR spectral channels the medium term radiometric stability is the radiometric stability evaluated between any two images separated by less than or equal to radiometric stability evaluated between any two sounding LAC’s or FDC’s separated by less than or equal to 24 hours.,1,,,,,,,,,
A triggered event occurs when the energy registered by a detector element exceeds the LI trigger threshold.,1,,,,,,,,,

In the definition of PSF the instruments are assumed to be linear.,1,,,,,,,,,
In order to achieve this transformation the radiance samples associated with the level 1b spatial samples are interpolated from the estimated grid to the reference grid to give radiance samples for each level 1c pixel.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Image navigation is used to derive the verification grid of past spatial sample positions, where means to derive this knowledge are available.",1,,,,,,,,,
When used to derive the position of future spatial samples based on past information the estimated grid is generated.,1,,,,,,,,,
Image registration is an indication as to how well image navigation knowledge is maintained and controlled between images separated over time or between different spectral channels or instruments.,1,,,,,,,,,
The pixel is constructed from a number of spatial samples that have been interpolated to the given reference grid location during the image rectification process.,1,,,,,,,,,
The measured site (MS) of a spatial sample corresponds to the estimate of the spatial sample actual site as derived from the image navigation process and used in the image rectification process or delivered as IDP auxiliary data with the level 1b data.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Ideally a corrected site corresponding to each pixel is measureable, but in practice only geographic features such as coast lines, mountains and lakes will be available.",1,,,,,,,,,
In practice the location of the geographic features will be to sub-SSD accuracy.,1,,,,,,,,,
Coregistration is used to describe the relative position of the spatial samples or pixels between different spectral channels of an instrument or between instruments.,1,,,,,,,,,
RSPKE is only given for spectral channels of identical spatial sampling distance.,1,,,,,,,,,
When the RPPKE between spectral channels with differing spatial sampling distance is A group of p2 of the finer resolution spectral channel pixels centred on a coarse resolution pixel is taken as a pixel group.,1,,,,,,,,,
Due to the properties of the reference grid this means that the fine resolution pixel group and coarse resolution pixel are located at the same position.,1,,,,,,,,,
Likewise the corrected site for the fine resolution pixel group is the mean corrected site of the fine resolution pixels.,0,,,,,,,,,

"There is only one scenario in the Item data communication process as described in problem statement of section 1.1. communicating the core item and cross industry data elements following the establishment of a business relationship between suppier, buyer or third party.",1,,,,,,,,,
The objective of this document is to elaborate the Data Synchronization Data Model for Trade Item (hereafter referred to as ‘Data Sync Trade Item’) business process in enough detail to support the construction of standards.,1,,,,,,,,,
The challenge is to provide the core elements necessary to complete all supply chain processes without duplicates.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Depending on the specific nature of the relationship other players may have a role, such as a Third Party.",0,,,,,,,,,
The Data Sync Trade Item business process begins when the parties decide to do business together.,1,,,,,,,,,
The next step is for the buyer to communicate the Party organizational information to the seller.,0,,,,,,,,,
The start-state of the Data Sync Trade Item business process begins during the initial discussions between the trading partners and the need to exchange item information.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Once the Data Sync Trade Item business message has been accepted by both the seller and buyer, then data alignment has been achieved.",1,,,,,,,,,
This process can be an ongoing process as item business information changes or new parties are added.,1,,,,,,,,,
The process of trading goods and services can now occur.,0,,,,,,,,,
The end-state of the Data Sync Trade Item business process occurs when the parties have achieved Party and Item data alignment.,1,,,,,,,,,
"To help with the implementation of this data model, several key definitions are listed below.",1,,,,,,,,,
Master data is considered to be that set of data that describes the specifications and structure of each item and party involved in the supply chain processes.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Transactional data is that set of data that can only be determined during a business transaction, i.e., plan, sell, buy, and deliver cycle.",1,,,,,,,,,
Such synchronization and use of Master Data leads to more accurate business transactions and therefore reinforces the efficiency of the supply chain operations.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Successful Master Data Alignment is achieved via the use of EAN.UCC coding specifications throughout the supply chain, communication of all changes and new information between trading partners and use of the information exchanged in subsequent transactions.",1,,,,,,,,,
An attribute whose definition is common across all Industries Core attributes are common across all geographies.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Industry user groups should be developed in concert with the EAN.UCC GSMP Process, to determine their relevant extension attributes and the conditions associated with those attributes.",1,,,,,,,,,
Values for an attribute can vary depending on the relationship with the party receiving the data.,0,,,,,,,,,
The condition Trading Partner Neutral is applied to any attribute whose value is independent on a buyer and seller relationship.,1,,,,,,,,,
"An attribute, which has the condition Trading Partner Neutral, can have only one set of values .",1,,,,,,,,,
The condition Trading Partner Dependent is applied to any attribute whose value is dependent on a buyer and seller relationship.,1,,,,,,,,,
"An attribute, which has the condition Trading Partner Dependent, can have only one set of values per GLN of Party Receiving Data.",1,,,,,,,,,
These are attributes whose value is dependent on a specific point-to-point agreement between a buyer and a seller.,0,,,,,,,,,
This condition is used to indicate that multiple values can be submitted for a trade item.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Where there is a need to express multiple measures, these are handled through indicating the attribute type as ‘Measurement’.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Where there is a need to express multiple language versions, these are handled through indicating the attribute type as ‘Text Description’.",1,,,,,,,,,
A Market Group is used to identify a proprietary group of data recipients.,1,,,,,,,,,
"It is the country, (the geopolitical area) where the product is to be sold and available for publication in an Item Catalog.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Target Market Country Code in relationship to Master Data, can be Trading Partner Neutral only.",1,,,,,,,,,
This condition can be used by information providers as they build data models.,1,,,,,,,,,
"With this information, they can limit the attributes communicated to those relevant for that geography.",0,,,,,,,,,
"A global attribute indicates that the attribute is relevant for business cases around the world, and can only have a single value throughout the world.",1,,,,,,,,,
"A global/local attribute indicates that the field is relevant for business cases around the world, that its definition is the same around the world, but may have a different value depending on the geography.",1,,,,,,,,,
"A local attribute is only relevant in certain geographical areas, and the values may change based on where the product is offered for sale.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Start availability date = January 1, Target Market can be repeated where the values for the attribute are the same g. start availability date is the same for the GTIN + GLN + TM combination data set.",1,,,,,,,,,
An attribute in this model is mandatory when its value is required.,1,,,,,,,,,
An attribute in this model is Optional when its value is not required.,1,,,,,,,,,
An attribute in this model is depended when its value is conditional on some other attribute’s value.,1,,,,,,,,,
"A Trade Item is any product or service upon which there is a need to retrieve pre-defined information and that may be priced, ordered or invoiced at any point in any supply chain.",1,,,,,,,,,
This condition is used to indicate at what level of the product hierarchy each attribute is relevant.,1,,,,,,,,,
"For some attributes, business requirements are such that the attribute only needs to be provided at a specific level.",1,,,,,,,,,
"For most attributes, a value must be entered for all attribute levels.",1,,,,,,,,,
Common value condition indicates when the value for the attribute is equal for all levels of a hierarchy.,1,,,,,,,,,
Where this differs from “QuantityofNextLowerLevelTradeItem” is that this field is used in conjunction with each GTIN identified in the field ‘NextLowerLevelTradeItem’.,1,,,,,,,,,
"If the item is not mixed, then this number will equal the value submitted for the “QuantityofNextLowerLevelTradeItem” field.",1,,,,,,,,,
Definition: Value indicates the number of unique next lower level trade items contained in a complex trade item.,0,,,,,,,,,
Business Rules: Allowed for more than 1 reference to lower levels to allow for the registration of Mixed Assortments.,1,,,,,,,,,
The sequence of entering GTINs is important when a next lower level GTIN is to be linked.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The next lower level GTIN must already exist, therefore the order of trade items to be entered should be from lowest to highest e.g. consumer, then intermediate, then traded, etc.",1,,,,,,,,,
The trade item identification that is being permanently replaced must already be in the home data pool in order to ensure data integrity.,1,,,,,,,,,
Please see PTRG directions for creating GTINs Business Rules: EAN.UCC numbering structures will be used for the identification of trade items.,1,,,,,,,,,
Must be present to enable data to be presented to trade item catalogue.,0,,,,,,,,,

"Once an attribute code is selected, it is mandatory to submit an associated value code.",1,,,,,,,,,
The purpose of this field is to identify the originator of the data.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The Target Market Subdivision Code describes the ""geo-political subdivision of a country"" where the trade item is available for sale, as determined by the information provider.",1,,,,,,,,,
It is important to note that the lack of the Target Market Subdivision code implies that the trade item is available in the entire target market country.,1,,,,,,,,,

"Once the project has received Executive Committee approval, this document will serve as a formal MOU detailing the agreed upon responsibilities and requirements.",,,,1,,,,,,
The plethora of forms coupled with most institutions collecting data on a per-subaward basis rather than on a per-entity basis has led to significant administrative burden without commensurate benefit from a risk management perspective.,,,,1,,,,,,
"The profiles themselves generally require updating at least twice per year, resulting in significant ongoing burden.",,,,1,,,,,,
"These results, along with the remarkable success of the original FDP Financial Conflict of Interest Clearinghouse that was eventually opened to non-FDP members and now includes more than 1000 entities, signified a need to change to a more automated and electronically robust process for the longer term.",,,,1,,,,,,
"At designated intervals (at least monthly), the system sends an email reminding entities to update their System will also be able to send reminders on certain data elements when the data has become out of date (SAM expiration date, Audit date, etc) A list of these data elements will be developed by the ECWG and provided to the ECSDWG.",,,,1,,,,,,
The FDP Expanded Clearinghouse Web-based system will require an initial team of developers and testers.,,,,1,,,,,,
"The project will require administrative, project management, and training duties that will be performed by the ECWG.",,,,1,,,,,,
To support the ongoing needs of this system the FDP will require an oversight committee to oversee and manage the system and the community’s data to ensure ongoing reliability and integrity of the system (ECWG).,,,,1,,,,,,
"FDP pilot institutions are required to alter their current subrecipient entity forms and internal processes to accommodate the expected data collection and data entry, including timeliness.",,,,1,,,,,,
"The FDP Expanded Clearinghouse will be maintained in the current Excel spreadsheet / PDF repository fashion until such time as a web-based system has been developed, testing and fully adopted.",,,,1,,,,,,
Pilot entities will be required to assist in the transition between methods/systems.,,,,1,,,,,,
"The system is intended to be available online 24 hours per day, 365 days per year with the exception of scheduled and pre- notified system maintenance downtimes, if needed.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Data will become immediately available for use, except for new profiles, which will be pending in queue for validation by an FDP administrator.",,,,1,,,,,,
The ECSDWG will review ISP/hosting provider options and once the initial development is complete will move the clearinghouse over to this for hosting the system.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Temporary inaccessibility, even up to several days, will not create a substantial burden on any user.",,,,0,,,,,,
It is expected that with the use of an IPS/hosting provider that downtime will be minimal or non-existent.,,,,1,,,,,,
"However, to ensure growth ability, flexibility is also required for both input and output modes.",,,,1,,,,,,
"To this end, the system will expose a RESTful API via HTTP to provide data in JSON format for external consumer access.",,,,0,,,,,,
"However, the FDP will also require that the system be flexible and customizable to suit their needs.",,,,1,,,,,,
The complexity of the system will limit the customizations available via the administrative interface at the FDP level.,,,,0,,,,,,
"As the developers complete portions of the application, they will make the updates available to ECSDWG for review.",,,,1,,,,,,
This iterative process will repeat until ECSDWG is satisfied with the software product.,,,,1,,,,,,

"If more space is required to justify compliance, please ensure that the substantiation is clearly cross-referenced to the relevant requirement.",,,,1,,,,,,
Hence work being carried out and supporting procedures are regularly checked throughout the accreditation period.,,,,0,,,,,,
This certificate of competence shall be issued to persons whose work includes that undertaken by a craftsperson and/or a craftsperson’s mate and is in addition to the requirement of a NERS Passport and any certificates / authorisations required by an adopting utility.,,,,1,,,,,,
"This means that they shall observe any capacity, size or geographical limitations along with any other constraints that apply to their accreditation.",,,,0,,,,,,
Where scope limitations preclude a Provider from providing a ‘complete solution’ to their (developer) client they must not have any involvement in controlling the work that falls outside the accreditation they hold.,,,,1,,,,,,
Where construction activities are being project managed the ‘project management’ Provider shall ensure that the work being done is within the scope of the ‘construction’ Provider.,,,,1,,,,,,
"However where the new infrastructure adoption agreement issued by the adopting utility company is with a ‘construction’ or ‘project management’ Provider who does not hold design accreditation that Provider may act as the primary interface between the (developer) client, the adopting utility and the design Provider.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Providers wishing to operate in specific and/or all DNO geographical areas shall demonstrate through their systems and procedures their ability to mobilise effectively, efficiently and safely in accordance with relevant legislation, scheme requirements, relevant DNO standards and specifications including G81 documents.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Providers that hold accreditation in any of the construction categories are not, also, required to hold project management accreditation, in those scopes, but where Providers also/do operate as a project manager, in them, they shall adhere to the requirements specified for the project management scope.",,,,1,,,,,,
This is because the criteria set for such a scope would require the Provider to meet the overall requirements of a full design scope thus the Provider would be capable of undertaking that scope in their own right.,,,,0,,,,,,
Accredited Providers not holding Design scope may therefore use Providers who do providing the design work is relevant to that Provider’s design accreditation.,,,,1,,,,,,
"These accreditation scopes apply both to Providers who either do not themselves carry out construction activities but who manage this work by subcontracting such activities to appropriately accredited Providers or to Providers holding a construction scope who wish to subcontract out activities, in other construction scopes that they don’t have the accreditation for, to other appropriately accredited Providers.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Therefore for each project management scope category, Providers are required to have documented procedures, processes and technical competencies in place to effectively manage the subcontract relationship and the quality of the work performed.",,,,0,,,,,,
In case of civil and cable laying activities Providers holding Project Management of those scopes could also sub contract work in those areas to 2nd tier accredited Providers.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Prior to applying for these scopes the Provider should discuss with the relevant adopting utility companies and determine their implementation plan phasing, their respective interface arrangements and any pre-requisite requirement for operational scopes.",,,,1,,,,,,
Network Connection scopes are a separate entity from Live LV Jointing and as such require additional evaluation and accreditation.,,,,1,,,,,,
Some DNO’s may require Providers to hold Live LV Jointing as a pre requisite before entering into relevant Network Connection pilot agreements.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Similarly work which does not fit comfortably into one of the above scopes will be allocated, at the discretion of the accreditation body, to an appropriate scope.",,,,1,,,,,,
Best practice is demonstrated when role specific competency requirements are built up from job descriptions which are broken down into job related tasks against which personnel can be assessed.,,,,1,,,,,,
The production of a competency matrix is recommended in particular for those Providers with Network Connection construction scopes to facilitate skills development.,,,,1,,,,,,
This may be achieved through a combination of education training and practical experience relating to the design activity undertaken.,,,,0,,,,,,
Those involved in delivering works as project managers shall have the technical competency to manage the subcontract relationship and interface with the adopting utility company to ensure that the works constructed are to specification for adoption in line with the adopting utility and industry standards.,,,,1,,,,,,
If employed on a contract basis then their responsibilities shall be clearly defined within the contract of employment.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Until such time as Qualified Supervisors have been assessed as competent to perform the role unsupervised by the Technical Advisor, and the decision documented, their technical audit function shall be overseen by the Technical Advisor, or someone assessed as being competent by the Technical Advisor.",,,,1,,,,,,
Where the Provider uses more than one assessing officer any one of those officer(s) can be nominated and appointed to manage the passport scheme.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Additional competencies shall be documented by the Assessing Officer, following satisfactory test and assessment, and be added to the relevant person’s competency record (passport) and if necessary by the reissue of a certificate of competence.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Where Assessing Officers are to assess the competence of persons to perform operations associated with the installation of electrical plant or equipment, then in addition to the above, they shall have knowledge of the electricity distribution networks, the Model Distribution Safety Rules, relevant adopting utility codes of practice, relevant areas of the Electricity, Safety, Quality & Continuity and the Electricity at Work Regulations.",,,,1,,,,,,
To assess candidates for work / operations in the Network Connection construction scopes the Assessing Officer shall be able to demonstrate sufficient knowledge and understanding of the Distribution Safety Rules (DSR) and Operational Procedures of the adopting utility and / or Provider depending on the interface arrangements that each DNO has in place.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Where the scope of work is of a specialist nature, e.g. 66kV/132kV jointing, then trained engineer status may be accepted as an alternative to the above requirement.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Where a scope of registration is not directly related to electrical activities, such as civil engineering works, then the qualified supervisor shall be able to demonstrate competence within their discipline equivalent to that defined above e.g. through holding a NRSWA Supervisors qualification etc.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Where the Provider’s authorisation is accepted by the adopting utility, the adopting utility may wish to document their acceptance of the Person’s authorisation.",,,,1,,,,,,
"However, craftspersons that are currently appropriately trained and/or hold valid adopting utility authorisations and have evidence of relevant employment during the immediate past three years do not have to fulfil the above criteria.",,,,1,,,,,,
In all cases- before a craftsperson and or craftsperson’s mate is allowed to perform work their competence to carry out tasks associated with that work shall be assessed by the Assessing Officer and given authority by the authorising officer.,,,,1,,,,,,
"In the latter circumstance, the Technical Advisor or Assessing Officer shall oversee the supervisor’s technical audit function until such times as the Technical Advisor or Assessing Officer considers the supervisor competent to perform the role unsupervised.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Although formal qualifications are not generally required for administrative posts, measures of performance should be in place which ensure that the quality of the administration service is satisfactory and complies with the requirements specified for the work being done.",,,,1,,,,,,
"Within the context of this scheme the holders of the defined roles of Authorising Officers, Assessing Officer and Qualified Supervisor shall have been appointed in writing and shall, in the cases of Assessing Officers and Authorising Officers have been accepted in writing (except where the senior executive of the Provider is the Authorising Officer).",,,,1,,,,,,
For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of giving authority to the competence of an individual the Assessing Officer and Authorising Officer shall not be the same person.,,,,1,,,,,
Such training shall include assessments to determine that an acceptable level of understanding has been achieved.,,,,,1,,,,,
In the case of specialist subcontractors it is not necessary to issue them with NERS passports.,,,,,1,,,,,
"If this sub contracted work involves subcontractor individuals undertaking craftsperson and/or craftsperson mate tasks and activities then, in addition to the passport requirement, those individuals shall also possess a certificate of competence issued and signed by the subcontractors (carrying out the work) Assessing and Authorising Officers.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The Provider subcontracting out the work should then satisfy themselves of the competence of such persons through their own procedures, and if necessary carry out their own assessments.",,,,,0,,,,,
If the subcontractor’s accredited scopes are not relevant then sub-contractors individuals shall be subject to the competency and authority procedures of the Provider sub-contracting out the work.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Providers shall maintain authenticated records of the ‘labour only’ contractor’s competencies and authorisations to support all competency claims, as documented in the ‘labour only’ subcontract staff NERS passports issued by the Provider.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Where they do, the Provider now employing them need not issue another passport but shall update and review the information within the passport in accordance with scheme requirements and shall, as with new passport issue, maintain records of competencies and authority’s to authenticate passport content.",,,,,1,,,,,
In the event that calibrated tools and equipment are sourced from a hire company then the order shall be placed with a hire company on the Provider’s approved supplier list.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Ground workers are contractors, who work directly on-site for developers and who may have a basic level of competence to excavate trenches, lay ducts and backfill.",,,,,1,,,,,
Work undertaken shall be to the standards and specification required by the adopting utility and in accordance with the working methods described in any method statements and work instructions.,,,,,1,,,,,
For the scopes of work undertaken Provider shall have documented method statements / work procedures detailing how the work is to be undertaken to the standards set by the adopting utility.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Except where adopting utility Codes of Practice are used these shall provide a full description of how the work is to be undertaken, the standards to which the installation will comply, the material specification and how these criteria will be measured on site.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Providers with Network Connection– Operational Activity scopes shall have documented operational procedures, or arrangements for working to the adopting utility’s procedures, in place.",,,,,1,,,,,
Providers with design accreditation shall establish a documented method statement/procedure that identifies the design process from receipt of enquiry/information from the client to handover of installation information (construction pack) to the constructor.,,,,,1,,,,,
This shall also provide for appropriate design support through the construction stage and shall be maintained and recorded.,,,,,0,,,,,
Providers with project management scopes shall ensure that the method statements of the contractors they employ deliver work to the scheme requirements.,,,,,1,,,,,
"This may be achieved either by benchmarking against internal documentation or by documented, formal review of the contractors method statements by the Technical Advisor.",,,,,0,,,,,
Providers shall have adequate procedures for assessing risk covering all key operations.,,,,,1,,,,,
"These shall identify associated risks, preventative measures, procedures and processes and methods of communication.",,,,,0,,,,,
Providers shall complete generic and/or project specific and site specific risk assessments as appropriate and these should be communicated to all relevant staff in advance of the work commencing.,,,,,1,,,,,
Providers shall establish procedures which ensure compliance with technical specifications and requirements for notices and communication specific to the adopting utility areas in which they operate.,,,,,1,,,,,
"For those Providers with Network Connection construction scopes, the adopting utility’s interface arrangements may also require reporting from site to the adopting utility’s control when staff arrives and when work is completed.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Providers shall, where the adopting utility requires an adoption agreement or contract to be set- up before the work commences, ensure that such documentation is in place and completed by all the required signatories before any work is commenced.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Documented procedures and processes should be established to control the technical elements of Tendering, Planning, and Construction elements of work carried out under this scheme.",,,,,1,,,,,
"These shall include processes for contract variation pre and post contract letting (including delegations of authority) and, where appropriate, feedback into the design process.",,,,,1,,,,,
A process shall be in place for work scheduling which shall ensure that adequate numbers of experienced / trained staff are allocated to effectively schedule work.,,,,,1,,,,,
Providers shall ensure that suitably trained and experienced resources are available to meet the work schedule programme and the effectiveness of the work scheduling process should be reviewed.,,,,,1,,,,,
Where required by the adopting utility Providers shall notify the Accreditation Body of work they are scheduling.,,,,,1,,,,,
Site supervision and the supervision of operatives and sub-contractors shall be at a level to ensure compliance with safety and technical requirements.,,,,,1,,,,,
Provider shall hold or have ready access to sufficient equipment to enable the timely and satisfactory completion of works under this scheme.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Materials, goods and services shall only be procured from suppliers / subcontractors which the Provider has approved.",,,,,1,,,,,
The level of assessment / audit should be determined by the criticality of the supplier / sub-contractor as determined by a risk framework process.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Providers shall establish and maintain procedures to ensure that all materials, goods and services are procured and delivered to the correct specifications/requirements of the adopting utility.",,,,,1,,,,,
Goods receipt processes shall ensure received goods comply with purchase requisition technical specifications and that any non-conforming product is quarantined and not accepted into stock.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The review period should be shorter for newly authorised staff and/or those found to have an area of weakness (i.e. knowledge / skill) as identified from routine monitoring (supervision), site safety audits, or operational incident.",,,,,1,,,,,
Providers with project management accreditation shall have a technical audit regime independent to that used by their contractors.,,,,,1,,,,,
"As part of an overall risk based audit programme Providers shall carry out site based Health, Safety, Quality and Environmental Audits.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Providers should ensure that reference libraries, for paper copies and electronic/on-line referencing, are kept up to date and that all information is current.",,,,,1,,,,,
Through their Quality Management Systems the Provider shall demonstrate that they have a good understanding of the requirements for constructing new utility infrastructure in accordance with the scheme.,,,,,1,,,,,
The accreditation body will take credence of any accredited quality management systems where these systems fully cover the scheme activities.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Providers shall demonstrate appropriate Health, Safety, Quality and Environmental provision that provide clear direction for the organisation to follow.",,,,,1,,,,,
Adequate procedures shall be in place to ensure compliance with the CDM Regulations both when the Provider has significant duty holder responsibilities under the Regulations or where the Provider is operating on a site controlled by others.,,,,,1,,,,,
Providers shall establish adequate procedures to ensure compliance with COSHH Regulations.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Providers shall establish a procedure for providing routine and ad hoc H,S&E briefings to operatives.",,,,,1,,,,,
Providers shall have a documented procedure in place for the investigation and reporting of accidents and incidents.,,,,,1,,,,,
Job descriptions shall be available for all personnel where the post holder’s activities can materially affect work activities carried out under this scheme.,,,,,1,,,,,
"As required for the accreditation scope this includes Designers, Project Managers, Technical Advisors, 1st line Managers (Supervisors), Team Leaders and Assistants etc.",,,,,0,,,,,
Where advisors are appointed on a contract basis to support activities their role and the activities they perform should be documented and details of the terms and duration of their contract shall be provided to the Accreditation Body.,,,,,1,,,,,
"All persons, issued with a passport, shall be made aware of its purpose and of the need to present it on site, when required.",,,,,1,,,,,
The Provider’s Assessing Officer shall be responsible for managing the passport scheme including keeping the passport annually reviewed and up to date and shall signify reaffirmation of a specific competency by endorsing and dating the particular page/series of pages that relate to the competency under review.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Where the Provider uses more than one Assessing Officer, any of those officers can be nominated and appointed to manage the passport scheme.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The Provider shall be responsible for the issue of NERS passports to ‘labour only’ subcontractors, the only exemption shall be temporary unskilled labour employed on a site for 5 days or less.",,,,,1,,,,,
Should the craftsperson or other operative gain employment with a different Service Provider then the individual would retain the passport and the responsibility for updating the passport would transfer to the new employer.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Because craftsperson’s and operatives may already hold a NERS passport (issued by a former employer who was an accredited Provider) then, when inducting new employees/’labour only’ sub-contractors, Providers shall check if they already have a passport that satisfies them and the scheme requirements.",,,,,1,,,,,
"If an individual already holds such a passport then the Provider need not issue a new one but shall, through their Assessing Officer, review and update information within them relevant to their new employment.",,,,,1,,,,,
Replacement passports should only be issued where the old one has been lost or has no space for the information it must contain.,,,,,1,,,,,
"When the passport is renewed the current employer shall be required to sign off the old passport, as would be required if a change of employment were to take place.",,,,,1,,,,,
The old passport shall be returned to the operative / craftsperson in order that an ongoing record of employment competency is held.,,,,,1,,,,,
Insurance cover to meet contractual requirements and guarantee liabilities will vary depending upon extent of work and adopting utility involved.,,,,,1,,,,,
Compliance with the requirements specified in this document will enable Provider to gain and maintain scheme accreditation.,,,,,1,,,,,
This section provides guidance on how scheme accreditation operates and the actions that will be taken in the event of non-compliance with the scheme requirements.,,,,,1,,,,,
The actual contractual terms and conditions will be those issued by the Accreditation Body when a formal quotation is sent to the Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,
Once a Provider has been assessed as satisfactorily performing the activities for which approval is sought a certificate of accreditation will be awarded which details the scope of approved activities.,,,,,1,,,,,
"At this stage the name of the Provider, along with the scope of works for which they are approved, will be added to the list on the accreditation body website.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Once they achieve Full accreditation, the Provider will be able to display the quality mark associated with the scheme.",,,,,1,,,,,
"To assist Providers preparing for assessment, especially those who are new to scheme accreditation in any utility sector, a desktop review or gap analysis is usually undertaken.",,,,,1,,,,,
Having gained Full accreditation the work and processes of the Provider are monitored by means of regular surveillance visits.,,,,,1,,,,,
"For Partial Accreditation the procedures, processes and documentation of the Provider are assessed for completeness and compliance with the requirements of the scheme.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Where such procedures and documentation are already in place, their implementation will be assessed.",,,,,1,,,,,
Subject to the outcome of this assessment Partial Accreditation may be awarded entitling the Provider to tender and obtain work which can then be used to demonstrate site activities during an assessment for Full Accreditation.,,,,,1,,,,,
Where a Provider has yet to recruit staff at the Partial accreditation stage they shall demonstrate that their recruitment strategy will ensure that competent personnel are in place before any work is commenced.,,,,,1,,,,,
"For the assessment Providers should ensure that the Accreditation Body’s representatives have access to those parties responsible for direct delivery of the work within the company and those who support the activity together with related processes, documentation and equipment.",,,,,1,,,,,
Following an assessment Providers will be given a month to provide whatever evidence is needed to close- out any identified deficiencies.,,,,,1,,,,,
After this period the Accreditation Body will issue a report concluding the evaluation and summarising the findings.,,,,,1,,,,,
At this stage the need for any further evaluation time to review deficiency close-out will be identified.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Providers will be subject to a surveillance visit to establish that the required procedures, processes and competencies remain in place.",,,,,1,,,,,
If these requirements are not demonstrated the Partial accreditation will lapse.,,,,,1,,,,,
Providers with Partial accreditation shall inform the accreditation body as soon as any work which requires accreditation is obtained so that an assessment for Full Accreditation can be arranged.,,,,,1,,,,,
Where the Accreditation Body identifies that a Provider with Partial Accreditation has been carrying out work without notifying the Accreditation Body their accreditation will be terminated.,,,,,1,,,,,
When a Provider demonstrates that they meet the requirements for Partial accreditation the Accreditation Body will issue a Certificate of Partial Accreditation, such certificates will remain the property of the Accreditation Body and shall be returned to them on their request.,,,,,1,,,,
Major deficiencies identified at the Full evaluation stage can lead to the accreditation body terminating the Partial accreditation of the Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,
The Full Accreditation of the Provider is dependent on the satisfactory technical assessments of activities for which accreditation are sought.,,,,,1,,,,,
To achieve Full Accreditation for any particular element of the requested scope then those elements shall be carried out by the Provider (or managed by the Provider if appropriate to the Provider’s scope) and witnessed and assessed by the accreditation body.,,,,,1,,,,,
"In order to progress from Partial Accreditation to Full Accreditation, Providers shall make each activity available for assessment at the first possible opportunity.",,,,,1,,,,,
Where work covering the full range of the scope requested is not witnessed the Accreditation Body will restrict any accreditation to the scope of work reviewed.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Award of Full Accreditation requires that procedures and processes assessed for Partial Accreditation, but previously untried, are fully implemented and are operating effectively.",,,,,1,,,,,
Facilities and access to sites shall be arranged by the Provider in order that the Accreditation Body can witness all appropriate work activities.,,,,,1,,,,,
Subject to satisfactory performance throughout the accreditation process Full Accreditation will remain valid for 3 years after which time a reassessment will be carried out.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Following completion of the assessment, and on acceptance of the ongoing surveillance program, the Accreditation Body will issue an Accreditation Certificate which will be valid for the term of the accreditation.",,,,,1,,,,,
The certificate will remain the property of the Accreditation Body and shall be returned to them on their request.,,,,,1,,,,,
Providers will receive a quotation in the form of a Request for Services (RFS) for scopes applied for.,,,,,1,,,,,
"This RFS must be agreed, and signed, by the Provider, prior to the assessment process commencing.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Following completion of the appropriate evaluation stage, Providers will be invoiced accordingly and shall be required to pay such charges promptly in accordance with the requirements as outlined in the Terms and Conditions in the RFS.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Where any payments become overdue, the Accreditation Body will be unable to commit to further services.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Dependent on status the Provider may, in some cases, be required to pre-pay all or a portion of the agreed RFS before the evaluation commences.",,,,,1,,,,,
Having gained accreditation the work and adherence to process of Providers will be monitored through routine surveillance visits.,,,,,1,,,,,
Surveillance visits and any extra visits needed to investigate substantiated reports of non-compliance will be chargeable to the Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,
"For those Providers with Network Connection construction scopes, the Accreditation Body shall endeavor to carry out unannounced surveillance visits as part of the surveillance programme, where this is practical taking into consideration the type of work being undertaken, the project duration, the notice requirements of the adopting utility’s interface arrangements and the liaison arrangements in place between the Accreditation Body and the adopting utility.",,,,,1,,,,,
Each approved activity scope and the Provider’s management system shall be subject to surveillance audit at least once during the three year accreditation period with the first surveillance visit held within a 6 months (maximum) of accreditation being awarded.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The surveillance programme is subject to a minimum of 6 visits throughout the accreditation period for construction activities, project management and/or control and management of constructions activities.",,,,,1,,,,,
In the case of Providers who only hold design scopes that minimum is 4 visits.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The Accreditation Body may, at its discretion and subject to reasonable notice, vary the interval between surveillance visits, based upon the results of Provider/Adopting Utility/Accreditation Body audits.",,,,,1,,,,,
Findings of Surveillance visits shall be documented and any deficiencies recorded shall be highlighted to the Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,
"For those Providers with Network Connection construction scopes- if any major deficiencies are identified whilst the work is being undertaken then the Accreditation Body will report the matter, immediately, to the adopting utility and Provider.",,,,,1,,,,,
The Provider’s Network Connections scope accreditation may be suspended depending on the circumstances and may be subject to investigation.,,,,,1,,,,,
"If the Provider’s staff are not in the location notified to the adopting utility the Accreditation Body may, in the absence of a reasonable explanation, suspend the Provider’s accreditation.",,,,,1,,,,,
The Accreditation Body may also charge for an aborted visit if the surveillance visit has to be re-scheduled.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Should the volume of the Provider’s work, or scope of the Provider accreditation, change during the accreditation period then the surveillance visit programme shall be revised accordingly.",,,,,1,,,,,
Where concerns about the compliance of a Provider are made to the accreditation body by adopting utilities or others additional investigation surveillance visits will be immediately arranged.,,,,,1,,,,,
If the non- compliance issue investigated is confirmed the Provider will be required to cover the cost of the investigation.,,,,,1,,,,,
In order that work activities can be assessed Providers shall make reasonable provision for contestable work to be available for surveillance.,,,,,1,,,,,
Where it is necessary to change pre-arranged visits Providers should give a minimum of 5 working days’ notice to the accreditation body.,,,,,1,,,,,
Where a surveillance visit is cancelled within the notice period an abortive visit charge based on the charge for a surveillance visit will be made.,,,,,1,,,,,
Where the planned activities are not being carried out at the time of the visit the Accreditation Body will make a charge for a further visit to assess the activities.,,,,,1,,,,,
At least annually whilst undertaking surveillance visits the Accreditation Body expects to meet with the appointed assessing officer (relevant to the scope of work under surveillance) to ensure that they are taking active responsibility for the duties which are assigned to their roles.,,,,,1,,,,,
During the accreditation period the Accreditation Body expects to see all the accredited scopes being demonstrated.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Where scopes of work may be infrequently carried out by the Provider, the Accreditation Body may, taking into account the general compliance of the Provider relax the frequency they expect to view such work.",,,,,1,,,,,
This arrangement will take account of the types of work the Provider normally focuses on and their surveillance programme and will only be allowed when the Provider agrees to notify the Accreditation Body every time work on the ‘infrequently’ performed scope(s) is being done.,,,,,1,,,,,
Other than for scopes of work which are done infrequently (see Section A1.3.3) in the event that the Provider’s programme of work does not incorporate any work meeting the requirements for a surveillance visit for a period which extends beyond one month of the surveillance visit due date then the accreditation status of the Provider shall be downgraded to Partial.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Under these circumstances the surveillance visit programme shall be suspended and annual (on the anniversary of the last surveillance visit) visits arranged to ensure that competency and procedures/processes, against which the initial accreditation was awarded, are maintained.",,,,,0,,,,,
As required for all holders of partial accreditation Providers who have had their accreditation status downgraded must notify the Accreditation Body of their intention to start any work relating to their accreditation so that a surveillance visit can be arranged.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Subject to the surveillance visit confirming that work is being done in accordance with the scheme requirements, and that the required procedures and processes are in place, then full accreditation shall be reinstated and a programme of surveillance visits re- established.",,,,,1,,,,,
If a Provider considers that their ongoing workload is less than that used to determine the surveillance visit programme they should notify the Accreditation Body and ask for the programme to be re-assessed.,,,,,1,,,,,
"However, as a minimum, to retain full accreditation Provider shall maintain their surveillance programme presenting each scope (unless infrequently carried out- see a.1.3.3) of their fully accredited activities and relevant management system for surveillance audit over the accreditation period.",,,,,1,,,,,
Providers will be charged for surveillance visits carried out in accordance with the agreed programme or any which are subsequently arranged to close-out major deficiencies or the suspension/removal of accreditation.,,,,,1,,,,,
Where any payments to the Accreditation Body become overdue the Accreditation Body is unable to commit to doing further visits.,,,,,1,,,,,
Fails to complete within the agreed timescales and to the satisfaction of the accreditation body required remedial action(s) identified during routine surveillance or any other investigation.,,,,,1,,,,,
Implementation of corrective action is subsequently found to have been inadequate to prevent a reoccurrence at any location of recently identified deficiencies.,,,,,1,,,,,
Is found to continually fail to maintain safe systems of working and has working practices which result in the workforce or members of the public being exposed to danger or serious risk of injury through the use of faulty workmanship/working practice and faulty materials or materials not conforming to recognised standards.,,,,,0,,,,,
Notifies the accreditation body that they no longer wish to be accredited for scopes of work.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Where the accreditation body is notified that unsatisfactory work or non-compliance with the scheme requirements has occurred and the matter is disputed by the Provider, the accreditation body shall carry out an investigation.",,,,,1,,,,,
Under certain circumstances an interested party or Provider may wish to escalate an issue to the accreditation body for further investigation.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Where the investigation is to be carried out following a complaint made by the adopting network operator or other party, the Provider shall allow the complainant to be represented during the investigation.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Where the investigation is to be carried out following a complaint made by the Provider, the interested party shall allow the complainant to be represented during the investigation.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Where, as a result of inspections, the work is shown to not to comply with the scheme requirements the Provider shall, at its own expense, take the required remedial action to remedy the work with the timescale specified by the accreditation body.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The accreditation body shall notify the Provider in writing of the intention to cancel certification, fully detailing such reasons for its action.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Normally, unless the nature of the non-conformance merits immediate action or is a reoccurrence of a recently closed deficiency, this will be in 2 stages.",,,,,1,,,,,
If the non-conformances are not satisfactorily addressed during the allotted time period and steps are not taken to prevent a reoccurrence the accreditation will be cancelled.,,,,,1,,,,,
Once accreditation has been cancelled then re-accreditation will be subject to a full re-assessment of the Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,
"If the Provider wishes to object to action taken, including withdrawal of accreditation, by the accreditation body they shall, within twenty-one days of the issue of the notification to them, give notice in writing to the accreditation body of their objections setting out clearly the grounds for an appeal.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The results of the review will be communicated to the Provider in writing, detailing clearly the basis for the decision.",,,,,1,,,,,
If the decision is not to the satisfaction of the Provider then they can appeal to the Scheme Advisory Panel which will be furnished with the basis for the original accreditation withdrawal and the findings of the appeals review.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Re-instatement of accreditation will be effected under the conditions prescribed by the accreditation body’s review or that of the Scheme Advisory Panel, should the finding be that the accreditation withdrawal was not warranted.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Alternatively, if the appeals process finds the accreditation withdrawal to be the correct course of action then re-instatement of the Provider would entail a full re-evaluation.",,,,,1,,,,,
At the end of the 3 year full accreditation period a reassessment covering all required scopes of accreditation shall be undertaken.,,,,,1,,,,,
The scale of this reassessment will take account of the performance of the Provider during the period of accreditation.,,,,,1,,,,,
If the Provider has performed satisfactorily over the accreditation period their accreditation is likely to be reviewed with minimum examination.,,,,,1,,,,,
"However if the work carried out by the Provider is limited, or if a number of audit reports identify major deficiencies or a growing trend of minor deficiencies, an appropriately more in depth level of re-assessment will be required.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Where this cannot be arranged the level of accreditation, subject to satisfactory verification of procedures and processes, will reduce to ‘Partial’.",,,,,1,,,,,
"However, where one of the scopes being re-assessed covers work that may be infrequently carried out (see Section A.1.3.3) then, provided the Provider has agreed this with the accreditation body and has notified all instances of the work being done, the accreditation body will take account of surveillance visits over the 3 year certification period.",,,,,1,,,,,
In such the accreditation body may re- certify at the ‘Full’ level without witnessing work being done.,,,,,0,,,,,
"If the Provider does not put in place adequate accreditation renewal arrangements, or allow adequate time for the required renewal assessment to take place, the accreditation will be terminated.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Where scopes are not witnessed during the re-accreditation, or there is not adequate evidence to support the award of ‘Full’ accreditation, these scopes may only be awarded ‘Partial’ status.",,,,,1,,,,,
After this period of time the Accreditation Body will issue a report concluding the accreditation.,,,,,1,,,,,
Having being satisfactorily reassessed and a surveillance programme agreed the Provider will be accredited for a further 3 years.,,,,,1,,,,,
It should be d that adopting utility companies have the right to insist on defective work being corrected and the right to refuse to adopt infrastructure if it is not fit for purpose even though the work may have been carried out by an accredited Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The accreditation body will notify all adopting utility companies when action is taken to amend, suspend or terminate the accreditation of a Provider.",,,,,1,,,,,
On gaining accreditation Providers will be issued with the NERS Scheme Registration Mark (which incorporates the LR Approval Mark).,,,,,1,,,,,
"Guidance on the use of this Mark will be provided when it is issued and the Mark shall only be used in the as issued configuration and can be displayed by accredited Provider on their stationery, publicity material, company buildings, flags, vehicles, and so on.",,,,,1,,,,,
Correct use of a NERS Mark is a contractual obligation and a NERS accreditation certificate can be withdrawn if a Provider misuses a NERS Scheme Mark and continues to do this after attention has been drawn to the misuse.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Also, if NERS accreditation is withdrawn from a Provider they must stop using the NERS Scheme Mark and, where necessary, withdraw any material carrying the Mark.",,,,,1,,,,,
Providers holding 2nd Tier accreditation shall not be able to compete for contestable work in their own right and can only operate as a sub-contractor to a NERS accredited Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,
Assessment for accreditation under the 2nd tier scheme only covers those areas relevant to the work being undertaken and takes into consideration the supervisory responsibilities of the NERS accredited Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,
"An induction process which should ensure that all staff undergo training in electrical safety awareness, manual handling, COSHH, drawing appreciation, risk assessment and company procedures.",,,,,1,,,,,
Issue their staff with appropriate work instructions unless a work instruction has been issued by the accredited Provider that clearly outlines the location and extent of work to be undertaken.,,,,,1,,,,,
This scope of accreditation does not allow Providers to procure cable or ducting.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Providers shall have a procedure in place to ensure that all tools, equipment, lifting tackle etc is tested / calibrated as required.",,,,,1,,,,,
The project management scope is for Providers who do not themselves carry out construction activities but who manage this work by subcontracting such activities to Providers with the required construction accreditation.,,,,,1,,,,,
Whilst these are detailed throughout the main body of the scheme requirements this summary provides an overview of the project management scope requirements to aid companies in preparing for accreditation assessments and ongoing surveillance visits.,,,,,1,,,,,
There is not normally a requirement for Providers who simply introduce contractors to the client and where the construction Provider does the entire liaison with the host utility and the on-site liaison with the client to be accredited as project managers.,,,,,1,,,,,
Hence they need to be able to demonstrate utility sector specific technical understanding and competence alongside their project management capability.,,,,,0,,,,,
"Scheme Requirements) and, additionally, where work is associated with craftsperson activities as defined in section 1.1 of Scheme Requirements - a certificate of competence signed by the assessing and authorising officer.",,,,,1,,,,,
"An assessment file should be compiled for each candidate providing background supporting evidence towards the competence required (i.e. previous authorities held, employment history, training details, experience and skills tests undertaken).",,,,,1,,,,,
The Assessing Officer may accept documented assessments of practical skills tests provided they are/were undertaken by a recognised training institution/facility.,,,,,1,,,,,
"For giving authority to an individual’s assessment of competence the Authorising Officer shall be provided the candidate’s assessment file, which shall include recommendation for the areas of work to be given authority.",,,,,1,,,,,
An auditable trail of the assessment process shall be maintained which when successful shall result in an entry in the craftsperson’s/operative’s passport to provide for ready site based evidence.,,,,,1,,,,,
"That assessment, if satisfactory, shall be given authority by the Provider’s Authorising Officer.",,,,,1,,,,,
The certificate shall include a declaration requiring signature that the holder understands and accepts the responsibilities associated with the duties detailed on it and is aware that a separate authority may be required where/before work is to be carried out on a 3rd party owned network.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Has been assessed as competent in having sufficient practical and/or technical knowledge and/or experience to enable the avoidance of danger personally and/or to others, and has also been assessed as being competent to carry out the following craftsperson tasks on electrical plant or equipment.",,,,,1,,,,,
"I am aware that a separate written authority will, or may, be required where and before work is carried out on a 3rd party owned site, system or network (this includes Distribution Network Operator and/or Independent Distribution Network I also understand that the authority indicated on the certificate, and any other authority associated with it, is only valid whilst I am employed on actual contract(s) operated by the company.",,,,,1,,,,,
As the holder of this authority I understand and accept my responsibilities associated with the duties detailed above.,,,,,1,,,,,
A procedure shall be in place for selecting and training individuals who the Provider feel may be able to undertake tasks associated with the installation/construction of electrical plant or equipment.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Ensure that where training under personal supervision is undertaken the minimum requirements in terms of duration, level of responsibility and limit of work activities are clearly defined.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Ensure selection, training and assessment process is documented and records maintained for all individuals even if they are unsuccessful.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Indicate responsibilities for identifying refresher training and initiating training when any changes in type of work, take place.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Ensure that before an existing assessment of competence is considered for annual renewal and thus allowed ongoing authority, a check is made that during the review period, work has been undertaken across the competence scope(s) originally given.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Include process and action where review finds that certain elements of work, across the competence scopes, have not been undertaken within the review period.",,,,,1,,,,,
Under such circumstances it may be decided that it is necessary for the jointer to perform such a joint under supervision to retain or regain that element of competence).,,,,,0,,,,,
Providers with partial accreditation can tender and obtain work for the scopes they hold.,,,,,1,,,,,
Full Accreditation is granted to Providers who have successfully demonstrated that they have adequately met the schemes requirements with respect to the construction of adoptable assets.,,,,,1,,,,,
In the case of Design Scopes the Provider has successfully demonstrated that their processes meet both the scheme and adopting company’s requirements.,,,,,1,,,,,
If a Provider’s has Project Management for a construction scope PM will appear after the voltage in the scope description i.e. Jointing (HV-PM).,,,,,1,,,,,
Granted when the first site works have been witnessed successfully.,,,,,1,,,,,
It is also applicable to NERS Providers who hold at least one construction scope and wish to sub-contract out work covered by other scopes that they do not have.,,,,,0,,,,,
In this situation they must utilise an appropriately accredited NERS Providers.,,,,,0,,,,,
Live jointing only allows jointing onto the main installed by the NERS Provider.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Providers holding Live LV jointing do not automatically hold Networks Connections scopes which are separate entities from Live LV Jointing and which requires a separate, additional evaluation and accreditation.",,,,,1,,,,,
Jointing LV Live is a pre-requisite for a NERS Provider wishing to obtain this scope.,,,,,1,,,,,
The purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the “Amazing Lunch Indicator” (ALI) software.,,,,,1,,,,,
This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a customer for its approval and a reference for developing the first version of the system for the development team.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The “Amazing Lunch Indicator” is a GPS-based mobile application which helps people to find the closest restaurants based on the user’s current position and other specification like price, restaurant type, dish and more.",,,,,1,,,,,
Restaurant owners can provide their restaurant information using the web-portal.,,,,,1,,,,,
An administrator also uses the web-portal in order to administer the system and keep the information accurate.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The administrator can, for instance, verify restaurant owners and manage user information.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Furthermore, the software needs both Internet and GPS connection to fetch and display results.",,,,,1,,,,,
"By using the GPS-Navigator, users can view desired restaurants on a map and be navigated to them.",,,,,1,,,,,
Different specification techniques are used in order to specify the requirements more precisely for different audiences.,,,,,1,,,,,
The mobile application will be used to find restaurants and view information about them while the web portal will be used for system as a whole.,,,,,1,,,,,
The GPS will provide the for the user to be able to use the functions in the application in a seamlessly manner.,,,,,1,,,,,
To avoid problems with overloading the operating system the application is only allowed to use 20 megabytes of memory while running the application.,,,,,1,,,,,
"With the mobile application, the users will be able to search for restaurants.",,,,,1,,,,,
There are several search criteria and it will be possible for the administrator of the system to manage the options for those criteria that have that.,,,,,1,,,,,
"The result of the search will be viewed either in a list view or in a map view, depending on what criteria included in the search.",,,,,1,,,,,
The list view will have one list item for each restaurant matching the search criteria and show a small part of the restaurant information so the user can identify the restaurant.,,,,,1,,,,,
The web portal will provide functionality to manage the system and the restaurant information.,,,,,1,,,,,
"It will also provide information about the system, for example show when there is a new update.",,,,,1,,,,,
Each of these three types of users has different use of the system so each of them has their own requirements.,,,,,1,,,,,
The mobile application users can only use the application to find a restaurant.,,,,,1,,,,,
"This means that the user have to be able to search for restaurants, choose a restaurant from that search and then navigate to it.",,,,,0,,,,,
In order for the users to get a relevant search result there are multiple criteria the users can specify and all results matches all of those.,,,,,1,,,,,
The restaurant owners will not use the mobile application but the web portal instead.,,,,,1,,,,,
The administrators also only interact with the web portal.,,,,,1,,,,,
They are managing the overall system so there is no incorrect information within it.,,,,,1,,,,,
The administrator can manage the information for each restaurant as well as the options for both the mobile application users and the restaurant owners.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Since there are multiple system and multiple GPS manufacturers, the interface will most likely not be the same for every one of them.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Since the application fetches data from the database over the Internet, it is crucial that there is an Internet connection for the application to function.",,,,,1,,,,,
Since the database is shared between both application it may be forced to queue incoming requests and therefor increase the time it takes to fetch data.,,,,,1,,,,,
"If the phone does not have enough hardware resources available for the application, for example the users might have allocated them with other applications, there may be scenarios where the application does not work as intended or even at all.",,,,,1,,,,,
"In the case that the project is delayed, there are some requirements that could be transferred to the next version of the application.",,,,,1,,,,,
"It also gives a description of the hardware, software and communication interfaces and provides basic prototypes of the user interface.",,,,,1,,,,,
"A first-time user of the mobile application should see the log-in page when he/she opens the application, see Figure 2.",,,,,1,,,,,
"If the user has not registered, he/she should be able to do that on the log-in page.",,,,,1,,,,,
"If the user is not a first-time user, he/she should be able to see the search page directly when the application is opened, see Figure 3.",,,,,1,,,,,
"Every user should have a profile page where they can edit their e-mail address, phone number and password, see Figure 4.",,,,,1,,,,,
"When a user searches by price, this view should be the default one.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The sorting header allows the user to sort the results according to price, restaurant name, distance, restaurant type and specific dish.",,,,,1,,,,,
A restaurant owner should be able to register on the web-portal in order to log in and manage the restaurant information.,,,,,1,,,,,
An administrator should also be able to log in to the web-portal where he/she can administer the system by for instance editing restaurant or user information.,,,,,1,,,,,
"Since neither the mobile application nor the web portal have any designated hardware, it does not have any direct hardware interfaces.",,,,,1,,,,,
The communication between the different parts of the system is important since they depend on each other.,,,,,1,,,,,
"However, in what way the communication is achieved is not important for the system and is therefore handled by the underlying operating systems for both the mobile application and the web portal.",,,,,1,,,,,
DESC: A user should be able to download the mobile application through either an application store or similar service on the mobile phone.,,,,,1,,,,,
"DESC: When a new/updated version or release of the software is released, the user should check for these manually.",,,,,1,,,,,
"DESC: Given that a user has downloaded the mobile application, then the user should be able to register through the mobile application.",,,,,1,,,,,
"DESC: Given that a user has registered, then the user should be able to log in to the mobile application.",,,,,1,,,,,
The log-in information will be stored on the phone and in the future the user should be logged in automatically.,,,,,1,,,,,
"DESC: Given that a user has registered, then the user should be able to retrieve his/her password by e- mail.",,,,,1,,,,,
"DESC: Given that a user is logged in to the mobile application, then the first page that is shown should be the search page.",,,,,1,,,,,
"When a selection is made, the location of the restaurant should be sent to the mobile phone’s GPS-navigation program.",,,,,1,,,,,
The user should then be navigated to the destination.,,,,,0,,,,,
"When the destination is reached, a user should be able to go back to the search page on the mobile application.",,,,,1,,,,,
By default the minimum distance is set to 0 km and the maximum to 10 km.,,,,,1,,,,,
DESC: Integers should be accepted as input when a user searches by price or destination.,,,,,1,,,,,
If the system receives an invalid input the user should be informed and prompted to insert an accepted input.,,,,,1,,,,,
"DESC: A user should be able to conduct a search by providing either restaurant name, restaurant description, restaurant address, restaurant type or restaurant menu in the free-text search field.",,,,,1,,,,,
DESC: If no match is found the user should be informed but kept on the search page in order to get the possibility to conduct a new search right away.,,,,,1,,,,,
"DESC: When viewing the results in a list, a user should be able to sort the results according to price, distance, restaurant type, specific dish or restaurant name.",,,,,1,,,,,
When sorting by price the results should be ordered from cheapest to most expensive.,,,,,1,,,,,
"When the sort button for a specific search option is clicked, then the order should be reversed and ordered in a descending matter.",,,,,1,,,,,
If the sort button is clicked again the order of the results should be reversed.,,,,,1,,,,,
"When filtering the results, only the existing results shall be affected and a new search query should not be sent.",,,,,1,,,,,
"DESC: On the mobile application, a user should have a profile page.",,,,,1,,,,,
"On the profile page a user can edit his/her information, which includes the password, e-mail address and phone number.",,,,,1,,,,,
Selecting an element in the result list should only take one click.,,,,,1,,,,,
Selecting a pin on the map should only take one click.,,,,,1,,,,,
Selecting the information link should only take one click.,,,,,1,,,,,
"SCALE: If the system loses the connection to the Internet or to the GPS device or the system gets some strange input, the user should be informed.",,,,,1,,,,,
"The messages should be encrypted for log-in communications, so others cannot get user-name and password from those messages.",,,,,,1,,,,
METER: Attempts to get user-name and password through obtained messages on 1000 log-in session during testing.,,,,,,1,,,,
SCALE: If a restaurant owner tries to log in to the web portal with a non-existing account then the restaurant owner should not be logged in.,,,,,,1,,,,
METER: 1000 attempts to log-in with a non-existing user account during testing.,,,,,,1,,,,
SCALE: If an admin tries to log in to the web portal with a non-existing account then the admin should not be logged in.,,,,,,1,,,,
SCALE: A restaurant owner and IP address should not be able to log-in for a certain time period after three times of failed log-in attempts.,,,,,,1,,,,
METER: 1000 attempts to log-in during the lock period after user account has been locked because of failed log-in attempts of three times.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The locking period should be half an hour, and during that period the log-in function is disabled.",,,,,,1,,,,
SCALE: An admin and IP address should not be able to log-in to the web portal for a certain time period after three times of failed log-in attempts.,,,,,,1,,,,
"SCALE: If a user wants to create an account and the desired user name is occupied, the user should be asked to choose a different user name.",,,,,,1,,,,
METER: Measurements obtained on 1000 hours of usage during testing.,,,,,,1,,,,
"SCALE: If a restaurant owner wants to create an account and the desired user name is occupied, the restaurant owner should be asked to choose a different user name.",,,,,,1,,,,
RAT: In order for future functions to be implemented easily to the application.,,,,,,1,,,,
DESC: Test environments should be built for the application to allow testing of the applications different functions.,,,,,,1,,,,
"In order to get a view of how to divide the requirements into different releases and what requirements should be included in which release, a prioritization of the requirements is needed.",,,,,,1,,,,
When prioritizing the requirements the ten most important ones were picked out first.,,,,,,1,,,,
"This was done with a simple “1 to 10” ranking method, with one being “not important” and ten “very important”.",,,,,,0,,,,
"Based on the elicitation meetings, and the perceived ideas of what was important to the different stakeholders, a number was set for each requirement.",,,,,,1,,,,
The numbers were then summed up for each requirement and the ten with the highest score were chosen to be prioritized with the cost value approach.,,,,,,1,,,,
These requirements were then prioritized according to the cost value approach and the results can be viewed under Appendix II.,,,,,,0,,,,
"However, it is more easily misused since someone could save all their money and put them on a requirement that they think is very important [3].",,,,,,0,,,,
"For instance, if two requirements are not very important it would be hard to determine which of those requirements that is more important than the other [3].",,,,,,1,,,,
"In conclusion, weighing the disadvantages and advantages of these methods against each other lead us to choose the five-way priority scheme.",,,,,,1,,,,
The three different releases were assembled so that each would work as a fully functional application.,,,,,,1,,,,
"However, these requirements are not vital for a functional application.",,,,,,1,,,,
They are more suited to act as additional features that can contribute to making the software product more attractive.,,,,,,1,,,,
The third release includes the requirements that can be afforded to discard if the project gets delayed or overruns the budget.,,,,,,1,,,,
The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7 THEME [SPA.2011.1.5-02]) under grant agreement n° 283576.,,,,,,1,,,,
"For the avoidance of all doubts, the European Commission has no liability in respect of this document, which is merely representing the authors view.",,,,,,1,,,,
Version 1.1 included the evaluation of 11 additional questionnaires received after iterating version 1.0 of the document.,,,,,,1,,,,
Most requirements could be met (e.g. the request to cover Iceland and Turkey fully (both are EEA member states) by the MACC models has been raised by EEA) or was dealt with during MACC-II but some are at least partly out of scope for the MACC services.,,,,,,0,,,,
The version 2.0 was submitted to user review and upgraded according to feedback.,,,,,,1,,,,
Issues (v6.1 - 6.3) add additional requirements and feedback from the service providers obtained during the short period of MACC-III (focused on data access and user interaction towards the operational phase) and updates the responses from the MACC-III team analysed until 6/2015.,,,,,,0,,,,
It thus includes the documentation of user requirements collected during the MACC series of projects.,,,,,,0,,,,
To ease implementation in the various services a re- ordering of user requirements was conducted to group the requirements by service where appropriate, some erroneous categorization of requirements as data policy was corrected (maintaining the original numbering).,,,,,,1,,,
Additional user requirements were collected during MACC and MACC-II and all user requirements were now numbered and tabulated to assure traceable responses to them.,,,,,,1,,,,
Several further user requirements were obtained during the short period of MACC-III (more in the light of the transition to the operational phase and user involvement).,,,,,,1,,,,
In this analysis the granularity of requirements is kept as they were raised from the originator (so often one requirement includes several sub elements) – this allows an easier matching to concrete services than splitting requirements to a very detailed level (which significantly increases their numbers).,,,,,,1,,,,
"The following lists of requirements separately listed for four sections (technical, data policy, data access, user involvement) serves as baseline to derive formalized service specifications and trace requirements back to the originating user (group).",,,,,,1,,,,
"It should be d that some requirements were erroneously categorized as “data policy” – these were now associated to their correct categories (“technical” or “data access”), but for the sake of traceability their original numbering was maintained, adding the new category tag in front, such as “T(DP)xxx”.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The requirements for the domains of air quality (AQ), climate forcing (CF), actually need very similar data, e.g. chemical composition, emissions, deposition fluxes, but for different purposes.",,,,,,1,,,,
It should be d that user requirements received lately (e.g. during the second user workshop in June 2014) are under investigation (to be continued in MACC- III as part of routine operations) and therefore no further response is yet stated in the last column for them.,,,,,,1,,,,
MACC air quality forecasts and analyses will serve as boundary conditions for further nesting activities of local and urban scale models.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Furthermore, an emission inventory for use in PASODOBLE will be provided by MACC as well as additional parameters that were derived within PROMOTE at European scale, like forecasts of UV or satellite based aerosol products.",,,,,,0,,,,
The following MACC data products are required by PASODOBLE during the development and delivery of the PASODOBLE services.,,,,,,1,,,,
"A timely, adequate and routinely delivery for the defined products is required, preferably two times daily (00:00 and 12:00).",,,,,,1,,,,
"The following MACC data products are required by G-STEP for demonstrating applications of space data and for encouraging the supply of local forecast information to relevant groups (e.g. health organizations), and for supplying information to environmental consultants.",,,,,,1,,,,
"It is important to represent the statistical distribution of irradiance values well, so that the assessment of solar energy applications is based on good coverage of background and extreme values.",,,,,,1,,,,
"For services of this kind to be helpful, they must be consistent with existent European policy structure (e.g. EU Clean Air For Europe (CAFE), Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution).",,,,,,0,,,,
"The ambition has been to assimilate such surface observations into operational modeling systems in order to improve analysis and forecast of AQ, and to use NRT data for NRT evaluation of model performances.",,,,,,1,,,,
"In MACC, NRT data is to be used not only for validation but for data assimilation, that is, to produce better air quality forecast and analysis over Europe and the globe.",,,,,,1,,,,
Browse images made available to the public and data only to registered users.,,,,,,1,,,,
Products (and results) need to be proven by peer reviewed articles.,,,,,,1,,,,
This data can then be used by the user for user specific tasks (e.g. for nesting procedures).,,,,,,0,,,,
For each meeting a dedicated report is available together with the respective presentations.,,,,,,1,,,,
"One important finding was that there needs to be a borderline of MACC-II service scope to allow small industries to work on the focused (regional, topical) post-processing, while those small businesses are ready to adapt to the evolving service delivery of Copernicus Atmosphere as long as its long-term sustainability is assured.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Representatives of national authorities expressed the required constraints for using MACC-II services: stability, continuity and sustainability of the service; if there are changes to the service then these must be very clearly documented to remove the possibility of non-existent trends being identified when in fact the ‘trend’ is due to a model upgrade for example.",,,,,,1,,,,
Several clear needs were expressed for further evolution of the service offering (e.g. consistency between daily products and long-term re-analysis and clear documentation of service changes), those requirements were again included into the recent User Requirements Document update.,,,,,,1,,,
"Those authorities named as their needed Copernicus policy services consultancy, scenarios / sensitivity studies and support in reviews; in many cases this would require on demand support possibly based on underlying routine processing of European data / models.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The MACC-II European air quality assessment reports were discussed and it was recommended to assess and document the consistency with the report (using the same name) published by EEA; furthermore the need for an advanced assessment report using only non-validated ground-based data was expressed, so that the annual MACC-II report comes timely for its utilization in the national reporting obligations.",,,,,,1,,,,
Requirements expressed during this workshop were also analysed in the User Requirements Document update.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Based on discussions at the 2nd MACC-II user workshop preceding the UAB meeting, members of the UAB made took some of those discussion items to concrete recommendations.",,,,,,0,,,,
A major discussion point was how the MACC-II regional ensemble forecasts can be of best use to national / regional downstream services so that duplicated efforts for global / European modelling can be reduced.,,,,,,1,,,,
"However, it became clear that further development work and discussion is needed (e.g. on the granularity and severity of such degradation points for well documented major impact) before this is mature for introduction into the service.",,,,,,0,,,,
The UAB regarded good communication on service updates and relevant meetings (e.g. user workshops) as important and recommended to re-initiate (as in MACC) issuing newsletters with general information, these newsletter should be published on a case-driven basis (a first one was published shortly after the UAB meeting).,,,,,,1,,,
"At the end of its first formal MACC-II meeting the user Advisory Board discussed the governance for the future Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service and recommended that the Service should continue to involve its own (topic-focused) User Advisory Board but at the same time the Commission should take care of a good communication between Service-internal user consultation, the Copernicus overall User Forum and the national user communities / formal representation for Copernicus.",,,,,,1,,,,
"During the MACC-II summer school in June 2013 the 62 participants contributed to user feedback within several dedicated working groups who analysed different parts of the MACC-II website, detected several errors and weaknesses and made recommendations to improve the information.",,,,,,1,,,,
Acknowledging the constraint of easy maintainability those FAQ could be linked from the catalogue selections when a user has chosen the relevant service / product or they could be accessed via a general “cloud of clickable key words”.,,,,,,1,,,,
These recommendations and further detailed findings of the summer school working groups shall be analysed and a FAQ concept for implementation in the operational Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service worked out during the MACC-III project (8/2014 – 3/2015).,,,,,,1,,,,
The UAB expressed the request for an uninterrupted service continuity and for informative communication to users about any changes occurring.,,,,,,1,,,,
The UAB was informed on preparations of a workshop (to be held 7 January 2015) to explore the best response to the user need for more complete chemical suite of species as output from the ensemble service.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Furthermore, the UAB suggested converting the user questionnaire available at the MACC website into an online tool for easier access.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Finally, the UAB discussed the future process for prioritizing user requirements during the operational Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service phase.",,,,,,1,,,,
At the current stage the consideration was raised whether for each requirement a number of users making this request should be added to guide prioritizing.,,,,,,1,,,,
"However, it was also stated, that requirements by “power users” (e.g. EC directorates or large commercial entities) who request large data amounts or provide their downstream services to large audiences could be prioritized as well.",,,,,,1,,,,
"These products are used in support of policy decisions, for alerting, and to get a better understanding of the origins of pollution.",,,,,,1,,,,
"During the workshop, use cases were presented, and news about policy-relevant products of MACC-III were provided.",,,,,,1,,,,
During a series of training sessions the audience received a more detailed introduction about where to find MACC-III products and how to use and interpret the data and graphs.,,,,,,1,,,,
The different roundtable discussions of the final session gave all participants the opportunity to provide their feedback and to make suggestions for MACC-III product refinements as well as new products.,,,,,,1,,,,
"During and after the workshop the product providers of MACC-III received very useful comments from representatives from nine different countries, users that will be able to set the path for the information which their national policy officers will require.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The interaction during the workshop has large potential to stimulate extended use of MACC-III products in Italy, but requires further coordination of different actors in this country.",,,,,,1,,,,
All members agreed that a UAB allows more detailed discussions of critical items than possible in a larger user workshop.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Its goal is to develop and demonstrate user-driven downstream information services for the regional and local air quality sector by combining space-based data, in-situ data and models - health community support for people at risk, hospitals, pharmacies and doctors - public forecasting and assessment support for agencies, tourist industries and sport event - compliance monitoring support on particulate matter for regional environmental agencies - local forecast model evaluation support for local authorities and city bodies Europe: air quality (forecasts and reanalyses), aerosol (SAT), UV, emissions.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The aim of G-STEP is to support the exploitation of Earth Observation data and information in order to assist business, research and public sector organisations.",,,,,,1,,,,
The project ENDORSE aims at a user-driven development of downstream services in renewable energies by exploiting the GMES Core Services together with other EO/in-situ data and modelling.,,,,,,1,,,,
Their requirements will be assessed once they become available.,,,,,,0,,,,
"For the services which originate from PROMOTE, the user requirements of PROMOTE Stage II (2006 – 2009) apply also to the respective MACC services and are referenced here as PROMOTE origin.",,,,,,1,,,,
Among many other tasks LANUV is responsible for the assessment of the air quality throughout the territory of NRW and at hot spots of air pollution to meet the national immission protection law (BImSchG) and international obligations (directives of the European Union).,,,,,,1,,,,
"UBA Air Quality coordinates air quality research as well as standardization, harmonization and quality control of air quality modelling as a base for the development of national air quality strategies and for the evaluation of air quality strategies of the Federal Länder and the municipalities.",,,,,,1,,,,

"When NASA Crew Transportation System (CTS) certification is achieved for ISS transportation, the Commercial Provider will be eligible to provide services to and from the ISS during the services phase of the NASA Commercial Crew Program (CCP).",,,,,,1,,,,
"The primary objectives are to provide for crew rotation capability for four NASA or NASA-sponsored crewmembers, henceforth called NASA crew, and to provide for an emergency crew return capability for these crewmembers at any time while the commercial spacecraft is docked to the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Secondary objectives include transporting a limited amount of ISS Program-specified pressurized cargo to the ISS, returning pressurized cargo from the ISS, and providing for a crew safe haven capability when the spacecraft is docked to the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
The spacecraft will be capable of transporting NASA crew to the ISS and docking 24 hours after launch.,,,,,,1,,,,
Mission launch opportunities must be accomplished within NASA-specified timeframes to accommodate ongoing ISS science operations and to minimize ISS traffic model impacts associated with other visiting vehicles.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Within a few hours of launch, NASA completes their crew medical assessments and baseline data collection process in NASA-provided facilities and hands the crew over to the CTS provider for transportation to the launch site.",,,,,,1,,,,

"After docking, the vestibule between the ISS and the spacecraft is pressurized and verified not to be leaking.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If the nominal docking attempt is not successful, or if an anomaly occurs near docking which would prevent docking at the nominal opportunity, the spacecraft backs out to a short safe distance and performs necessary reconfigurations, followed by a second approach and docking attempt.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If that docking is also unsuccessful, the spacecraft will separate from the ISS vicinity on a collision-free safe trajectory and the spacecraft will prepare for a final re-rendezvous and docking attempt on the following crew day.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If this final docking attempt is unsuccessful, the mission will be terminated, and the crew will return to Earth.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Because of the short time duration from launch to docking, internal maintenance of the spacecraft should not be necessary, nor should the crew require certain complex habitability items for food and waste management that can be found on longer duration vehicles, like the Space Shuttle or the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
Extravehicular Activity (EVA) will not occur because the complexity of preparing for and executing an EVA is precluded due to the short time in the spacecraft early in the mission.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Similarly, EVA will not be performed during the short free-flight duration from undocking to landing.",,,,,,1,,,,
The spacecraft remains quiescent and requires minimal maintenance during docked operations.,,,,,,1,,,,
The ISS will provide power and environmental resources to the spacecraft in order to maintain the vehicle in a return-to-Earth ready state.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Due to limitations in the number of docking ports on the ISS, the spacecraft may need to be relocated from one docking port to another during ISS increment operations to provide operational flexibility.",,,,,,1,,,,
"To accomplish this relocation, the spacecraft’s full crew complement will ingress the spacecraft, close the hatch, and the spacecraft will be relocated from one port to the other port.",,,,,,1,,,,
"When docked to the ISS, the spacecraft also provides a contingency “safe haven” capability allowing the crew to retreat to the spacecraft, close the hatch, and remain in a safe environment for up to 24 hours.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If necessary, the spacecraft atmosphere will be purged during this activity.",,,,,,1,,,,
The ISS will provide attitude control during this 24-hour period.,,,,,,0,,,,
"After the ISS returns to a habitable environment state, the crew will open the hatch and re-enter the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If the ISS cannot achieve a habitable state during this period, the crew will return to Earth.",,,,,,1,,,,
"While docked to the ISS, the spacecraft will also serve as an emergency return vehicle for contingencies requiring the return of the crew brought to the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Emergencies could result from ISS system failures, an uninhabitable crew environment, or a medical event requiring the return of the crewmembers.",,,,,,1,,,,
The crew will return to Earth within 24 hours of a declaration of an intention to return early.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Due to the limited size and power available, the spacecraft is expected to have basic first aid and life support capability to respond to immediate medical conditions in the free-flight mode.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If the Commercial Provider has received NASA approval to fly non-NASA crew to the ISS, the spacecraft will need to provide food, water, clothing, Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) consumables, and other logistics for these crewmembers for the docked timeframe, since NASA does not generally pre-position these supplies on the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
"After handover is complete, the current increment crew will return in the spacecraft.",,,,,,1,,,,
"When available consumables permit, the spacecraft will potentially circumnavigate the ISS while in proximity to assess the external configuration of the ISS prior to final departure.",,,,,,1,,,,
"During this circumnavigation, the crew will capture imagery to allow post-flight analysis of the ISS configuration.",,,,,,1,,,,
"This reduces risk by minimizing rescue force assets, increasing proximity to U.S. medical facilities, increasing security, and ensuring a prepared landing site free of hazards.",,,,,,1,,,,
"If the nominal deorbit maneuver is waived-off after separation from the ISS, a subsequent landing at an alternate landing site, with nearby recovery forces, will be possible.",,,,,,1,,,,
The spacecraft may also perform orbital maneuvers in low Earth orbit (LEO) to better accommodate alternate landing sites.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Returning crew will be deconditioned and potentially have impaired musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary, and neurovestibular capabilities as a result of long duration exposure to the micro-gravity and space environment, resulting in degraded crewmember performance in the post- landing timeframe.",,,,,,1,,,,

"Rationale: A normal ISS increment is 180 days, requiring a new replacement crew to be launched approximately two times per year.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The CTS shall simultaneously operate two spacecraft, to allow an ISS NASA crew handover.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The launch of the next rotation mission may occur prior to the departure of the current increment crew working on the ISS, resulting in a direct crew handover period where two commercial spacecraft would be docked to the ISS for approximately 7 to 10 days.",,,,,,1,,,,
Rationale: ISS crew time is reserved for science and other operations.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The spacecraft design should not require commanding, active monitoring, and maintenance during quiescent docked operations to avoid impacts to the ISS crew science productivity.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Additionally, this will reduce the overall burden on the ground infrastructure required to support this spacecraft while docked to the ISS.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The CTS shall complete the mission without requiring an EVA for nominal operations, contingency operations, or to perform maintenance activity.",,,,,,1,,,,
Rationale: EVA will not occur because of the short time in the spacecraft early in the mission when the complexity of preparing for and executing an EVA precludes that activity.,,,,,,1,,,,
"EVAs during the docked timeframe impact ISS crew time, consumables, and on-going science activities.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Finally, the timeframe at the end of the flight is envisioned to be a short free-flight duration from undocking to landing, which precludes EVA.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: Unless specifically d in requirement 3.1.1.6 or SSP 50808, the CTS must provide all the supplies necessary for space flight to meet the functions described in CCT- REQ-1130.",,,,,,1,,,,
"It is easier for the crew to have the same individual item and familiarity and training with the common items (e.g., Medical Kit) during both the free-flight and docked portions of the mission.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The CTS shall provide habitable consumables, such as food, water, clothing, oxygen, nitrogen, CO2 removal, personal hygiene, and other required consumables, for non-NASA crew during the docked portion of the mission when the non-NASA crewmembers are on the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: For any mission model that requires additional crew beyond the 4 NASA crew required for the ISS increment, the CTS will be responsible for carrying the required logistics in the spacecraft to support the additional crewmembers during docked timeframe.",,,,,,1,,,,
"NASA will not have the ability to pre-position supplies on ISS via another cargo launch vehicle due to the required ISS logistics support via Cargo Resupply Contract (CRS), Progress, and Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV)/H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) vehicles.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Thus, the CTS will be responsible for providing food, water, clothing, and other logistics for non-NASA crew.",,,,,,1,,,,
The nitrogen only needs to be provided if any equipment or operation to support the non-NASA crew is venting air overboard as part of its nominal operation.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The CTS shall accommodate 1, 2, 3, and 4 NASA crewmembers during a single mission.",,,,,,1,,,,
Rationale: Four NASA crew are required to be transported and returned to the ISS during a single mission to meet the United States Operations Segment (USOS) demand for crew time based on full utilization of the ISS to perform science and support the ISS National Laboratory Program.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Additionally, the CTS must be able to perform the mission with crew complements of 1, 2, 3, or 4 crewmembers in a single launch or landing to provide flexibility in the ISS crew rotation plan.",,,,,,1,,,,
The ISS requires continuous presence of the spacecraft to support sustained operations.,,,,,,1,,,,
The nominal crew rotation will occur at approximately 180 days based on the ISS human research program medical data collection needs.,,,,,,1,,,,
It is possible for this rotation to be altered by one month (earlier or later) in order to accommodate other overall ISS Program requirements or anomaly resolution/response.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: Launching from a designated U.S. (or U.S. State Department approved) launch sites reduces risk by minimizing necessary abort recovery force assets, increasing proximity to U.S. medical facilities, increasing security, and ensuring a prepared launch and emergency landing site, which minimizes unknown hazards and potential security issues.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: Returning to a designated continental U.S. landing site or waters directly extending from the coast reduces risk by minimizing necessary recovery force assets, increasing proximity to U.S. medical facilities, increasing security, and ensuring a prepared landing site free of hazards.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Deconditioned crewmembers have impaired musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary, and neurovestibular capabilities as a result of long duration exposure to the micro-gravity and space environment, resulting in degraded crewmember performance in the post-landing timeframe.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Because of the deconditioned state of the crew, special considerations need to be provided for medical and other post-landing care.",,,,,,1,,,,
These items required for crew sustenance and operations of the spacecraft will be provided by the CTS and will be allocated mass and volume in addition to cargo goals defined below.,,,,,,0,,,,
The spacecraft shall accommodate 100 kg (220.5 lbm) of soft stowage cargo in the pressurized volume during a single mission.,,,,,,1,,,,
The cargo will be contained in either a standard set of ISS soft stowage cargo to easily accommodate transfer by the crew onorbit.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The spacecraft shall accommodate an additional 100 kg (220.5 lbm) of soft stowage cargo in lieu of a NASA crewmember during a single mission per requirements in SSP 50833, Section 3.1.2, except for Triple CTB's in section 3.1.2.1 and all M-Bags in section 3.1.2.2.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The transport of an additional 100 kg of soft stowage cargo in lieu of a NASA crewmember provides the capability to react to situations that dictate the timely delivery and return of ISS components, supplies, and science hardware due to operational needs of the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
The concept proposed is that the seat would be removed to allow for a cargo pallet or other structure to be flown in its place in order to properly restrain the cargo.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The spacecraft shall accommodate hard mounted time-critical cargo consisting of either two powered single middeck lockers or one powered double middeck locker in the pressurized volume during a single mission, and maintain cargo services per requirements in SSP 50833, Section 3.1.1 while installed.",,,,,,1,,,,
"ISS power necessary for the locker(s) will be provided from docking until payload transfer in addition to, not in lieu of, all other power allocations specified herein or within SSP 50808, such as requirement 3.4.2.5, ISS Safe Haven or SSP the locker(s) are required in addition to, not in lieu of or included within, all other mass and volume requirements specified herein, i.e., the 100kg (220.5 lb) of pressurized cargo defined in requirements 3.1.3.1 and 3.1.3.5.",,,,,,1,,,,
The middeck locker(s) would be provided by the ISS Program either prior to launch or during onorbit operations to be transported to or from the ISS with a known quantity of science samples inside.,,,,,,1,,,,
"When the need arises, operational flexibility is required to allow the ISS Program to fly additional passive cargo within the mass and volume of the powered lockers.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The spacecraft shall accommodate additional time-critical hard mounted cargo consisting of either two powered single middeck lockers or one powered double middeck locker, during a single mission in lieu of the soft stowage cargo required by 3.1.3.1.",,,,,,1,,,,
"ISS power necessary for the locker(s) will be provided from docking until payload transfer in addition to, not in lieu of, all other power allocations specified herein or within SSP 50808, such as 3.4.2.5 ISS Safe Haven or SSP 50808, 3.2.2.4.1.3 Power Consumption.",,,,,,1,,,,
The middeck locker(s) would be provided by ISS either prior to launch or during onorbit operations to be transported to or from ISS with a known quantity of science samples inside.,,,,,,1,,,,
"The CTS shall maintain cargo services per SSP 50833, Sections 3.1.1 and install time-critical cargo within 24 hours of a scheduled launch.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Rationale: Once time-critical cargo has been handed over from the ISS program, it is critical that cargo services be maintained to ensure the integrity of the cargo.",,,,,,1,,,,
"Late cargo installation, within 24 hours of scheduled launch, is required to maintain the integrity of time-critical cargo.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The CTS may select the specific integration window, as long as it is within 24 hours of scheduled launch.",,,,,,1,,,,
The time-critical cargo installation may include an Integrated Verification Test (IVT) to verify the interface between the spacecraft and the payload and must be completed within the L-24 window of opportunity.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Once installed, the CTS must maintain cargo services, if required, until the cargo is removed for transfer to the ISS.",,,,,,1,,,,
"In the event that a launch is scrubbed or delayed and rescheduled, access to remove and re-install the time-critical cargo would need to be provided as well.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The CTS shall remove ISS time-critical cargo from the spacecraft no later than 1 hour after crew egress, post-docking and post-landing at a supported landing site.",,,,,,1,,,,
Rationale: Early cargo access after spacecraft docking and landing is required to maintain the integrity of time-critical cargo.,,,,,,1,,,,
"On orbit, the ISS crew must perform post-docking procedures quickly such that the cargo transfer can also occur no later than one hour after crew egress from the spacecraft.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The CTS will provide the capability to retrieve time-critical cargo within 1 hour upon completion of crew egress after post-landing and post-docking, while also providing continuous cargo services, per SSP 50833.",,,,,,1,,,,
The ISS program requires the operational flexibility to best utilize crew time and manage the crew day.,,,,,,1,,,,
Mission priorities may preclude cargo transfer immediately following docking or prior to undocking requiring the spacecraft to maintain the specified environment and services until cargo transfer can be completed.,,,,,,1,,,,
"In these scenarios, the spacecraft will receive the necessary ISS resources, e.g. power and intermodule ventilation (IMV), to support this mode of operation.",,,,,,0,,,,
"The launch vehicle, spacecraft, and ground infrastructure must be designed to have a high launch probability once the vehicle is in the final stages of preparation for launch.",,,,,,1,,,,
"The timeframe begins with booster tanking on the launch day, which signals a commitment to launch on that day and ends when a launch is no longer possible due to performance limitations.",,,,,,1,,,,
